The task for Emmanuel Macron is to deliver change, prosperity, unity and healing," the newspaper wrote.The right-of-centre Daily Mail simply highlighted the winner''s strong lead. "Macron by a mile," it said.An early edition front page of Liberation, the left-leaning French newspaper jointly founded by the late philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, simply declared "Well played," alongside a portrait of Macron."Macron elected," it said on its website, alongside several pictures of the 39-year-old. "I will do all I can to be worthy of your trust and confidence," it quoted Macron as saying.Le Monde''s website carried Macron''s picture in the foreground, with defeated rival Le Pen in shadow. "I will defend France, its vital interests. Its image," its headline quoted him saying.Conservative German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said "Europe has avoided the nightmare"."The unthinkable has been avoided: France will not be led by a woman of the far-right. The clear victory of Emmanuel Macron provides reassurance, but Europe must not be under any illusions."- Left-wing daily Tageszeitung wrote that "the clear victory of Emmanuel Macron is an enormous relief for France".The New York Times was understated in its coverage on its homepage, simply saying: "Macron wins decisive victory in France."In a later editorial, it said Macron''s "was a victory of hope and optimism over fear and reaction; of a future in Europe rather than in resentful isolation".However, it noted that "Mr. Macron faces formidable challenges. He is taking charge of a nation deeply divided, much like the United States, Britain and other major democracies, with many people feeling marginalized by globalization, economic stagnation, an unresponsive government, unemployment, faceless terrorism and a tide of immigrants".In an opinion piece for Fox News, the most-viewed US cable news channel and a favourite of American conservatives, executive editor John Moody, said "France has taken the easy way out, and voted for more of the same".He added: "He wants France to stay in the European Union and continue its open borders policy that has brought thousands of Muslim immigrants to France. When asked what he would do about Islamic terrorism, candidate Macron said: ''This threat will be a fact of daily life in the coming years.'' How''s that for taking decisive action?"The business daily Vedomosti said on its website that France had chosen the candidate that most represented the principles of The Fifth Republic: of an elite qualified to engage in European integration."The online newspaper Gazeta.ru pictured Macron addressing French voters, saying the incoming president would "have to respond to the demands for change".El Pais declared on its homepage: "France chooses Macron and restrains populism," noting in an editorial: "France said no. The victory in the presidential election of Emmanuel Macron, a pro-European and liberal ex-banker, restrains the wave of populist discontent that triumphed in November in the US presidential elections and before the UK referendum. At the head of the new movement En Marche!, he decisively defeated Marine Le Pen, aligned with US President Donald Trump and Russian Vladimir Putin."Public television commented on the "importance" of Macron''s victory but also pointed to the high abstention rate.The online edition of Greek daily Kathimerini hailed Macron''s "impressive victory".Le Temps carried pictures of joyous Macron supporters on its website and said the election''s principal outcome was that France had chosen "a new man to begin its transformation".', '2017-05-08 11:04:22', 'i1.jpg', 2, 1.1, '"- Left-wing daily Tageszeitung wrote that "the clear victory of Emmanuel Macron is an enormous relief for France".The New York Times was understated in its coverage on its homepage, simply saying: "Macron wins decisive victory in France.PARIS: The world''s media largely hailed the thumping victory of pro-EU centrist Emmanuel Macron in France''s presidential election on Sunday, but sounded a note of caution about the task ahead.Here is some early global reaction from the press on Macron''s victory over far right rival Marine Le Pen to become the country''s youngest president.The Financial Times heralded the results, but cautioned that "Macron''s victory is incomplete" and warned that the electoral race "legitimised the French far right as never before"."Public television commented on the "importance" of Macron''s victory but also pointed to the high abstention rate.The online edition of Greek daily Kathimerini hailed Macron''s "impressive victory".Le Temps carried pictures of joyous Macron supporters on its website and said the election''s principal outcome was that France had chosen "a new man to begin its transformation"."The business daily Vedomosti said on its website that France had chosen the candidate that most represented the principles of The Fifth Republic: of an elite qualified to engage in European integration."The online newspaper Gazeta.ru pictured Macron addressing French voters, saying the incoming president would "have to respond to the demands for change".El Pais declared on its homepage: "France chooses Macron and restrains populism," noting in an editorial: "France said no.', 1, 24, 63, 8, 1),

President Muhammadu Buhari said Saturday that some Boko Haram prisoners had been released for the freedom of the schoolgirls, but he did not give any details.The freed young women were flown Sunday by military helicopters from northeastern Nigeria to Abuja, the capital, where they were expected to meet the president."They will face a long and difficult process to rebuild their lives after the indescribable horror and trauma they have suffered at the hands of Boko Haram," said Pernille Ironside, acting representative of UNICEF Nigeria.Authorities say 113 schoolgirls remain missing of the 276 girls abducted from their boarding school in 2014. Girls who escaped said some of their classmates had died from illness. Others did not want to come home because they''d been radicalized by their captors, they said.Human rights advocates also fear some of the girls kidnapped from the Chibok boarding school were used by Boko Haram to carry out suicide bombings.In Nigeria''s capital, Abuja, anxious families were awaiting the official list of names of the 82 schoolgirls freed. Some parents have not lived long enough to see their daughters released, underscoring the tragedy of the three-year-long saga.Last year, 21 other Chibok girls were liberated in October and they have been undergoing counseling for months. It was not immediately clear whether the newest girls freed Saturday would join them.Those girls are still in government care in Abuja for medical attention, trauma counseling and rehabilitation, according to the government. Human rights groups have criticized the decision to keep the girls in custody in Abuja, nearly 900 kilometers (560 miles) from Chibok.The newly freed schoolgirls should be quickly released to their families and not be subjected to lengthy government detention, Amnesty International ''s Nigeria office said, adding that they don''t deserve to be put through a "publicity stunt" and deserve privacy.The International Committee of the Red Cross , which along with the Swiss government has mediated negotiations between Nigeria''s government and Boko Haram, said the girls soon would meet with their families.Saturday''s release marks the largest negotiated release so far of the 276 girls whose abduction in 2014 drew international attention to the threat of Nigeria''s extremists. Boko Haram has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, and has increasingly carried out attacks in neighboring countries.The mass kidnapping horrified the world and brought Boko Haram international attention. The failure of Nigeria''s former government to act quickly to free the girls sparked a global Bring Back Our Girls movement; US first lady Michelle Obama posted a photo with its logo on social media.The Bring Back Our Girls campaign said Sunday it was happy that Nigeria''s government had committed to rescuing the 113 remaining schoolgirls."We urge the president and his government to earnestly pursue the release of all our Chibok girls and other abducted citizens of Nigeria," the group said in a statement.The schoolgirls kidnapped from Chibok in 2014 are among thousands of people abducted by Boko Haram over the years.A Nigerian military official with direct knowledge of the rescue operation said the freed girls were found near the town of Banki in Borno state near Cameroon.Buhari late last year announced Boko Haram had been "crushed," but the group continues to carry out attacks in northern Nigeria and neighboring countries.

The exact list will be released Monday morning ahead of the hearing, set to begin at 2:30 pm (1830 GMT).The Maryland federal judge had issued a nationwide block on the ban''s core provision concerning travel from the Muslim world, saying the orderraised the prospect of religious bias. That decision came just after a broader one issued in Hawaii that halted the travel ban as well as a 120-day suspension of the US refugee admissions program. The White House is fighting that ruling in the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Department lawyers arguing on behalf of the Trump administration must make the case that the decree is necessary to ensure national security and that it does not amount to the so-called Muslim ban Trump had threatened to impose while running for office.The scope of Trump''s revamped ban, signed in early March, was reduced from his original January effort, which blocked travelers from seven-majority Muslim countries as well as all refugees. The first decree,which prompted mass protests and sowed chaos at US airports,was blocked by a court in Washington state on the grounds that it violated the constitution''s prohibition of religious discrimination, a ruling that was upheld on appeal. The modified version removed Iraq from the ban, but ran into the same objections.Although it does not explicitly mention Muslims, US District Judge Theodore Chuang of Maryland accepted arguments that Trump''s history of anti-Muslim rhetoric presented "a convincing case" that the second executive decree amounted to "the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban." Chuang issued his nationwide ruling in March over a complaint filed by civil rights and refugee advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).Trump has vowed to fight the "flawed" ruling all the way to the Supreme Court,to which he recently appointed a conservative justice,describing it as "unprecedented judicial overreach." A panel of three federal judges will review the Hawaii judgment on appeal later this month at a court in Seattle, Washington.The Justice Department is appealing that decision in the Richmond court, backed by around a dozen Republican-led states, while several Democratic-led states are supporting the ACLU and other defendants.', '2017-05-08 09:28:00', 'i8.jpg', 2, 0, 'WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump ''s amended travel ban will face a key test on Monday as a US appeals court is set to take on a case that has stymied the administration''s controversial efforts to bar travelers from six Muslim-majority countries.A Richmond, Virginia-based federal court will hold a crucial hearing to scrutinize a Maryland judge''s ruling that dealt Trump a humiliating blow by freezing his second attempt to close US borders to citizens of Iran,Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days.Given the public importance of the case and the need for a timely decision, the Fourth US Circuit Court of Appeals will head straight for a full-court, or "en banc" hearing - bypassing the usual initial three-judge panel - for the first time in a quarter-century.The court has 15 active judges, some of whom could recuse themselves because of potential conflicts of interest.Justice Department lawyers arguing on behalf of the Trump administration must make the case that the decree is necessary to ensure national security and that it does not amount to the so-called Muslim ban Trump had threatened to impose while running for office.The scope of Trump''s revamped ban, signed in early March, was reduced from his original January effort, which blocked travelers from seven-majority Muslim countries as well as all refugees.The modified version removed Iraq from the ban, but ran into the same objections.Although it does not explicitly mention Muslims, US District Judge Theodore Chuang of Maryland accepted arguments that Trump''s history of anti-Muslim rhetoric presented "a convincing case" that the second executive decree amounted to "the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban."The exact list will be released Monday morning ahead of the hearing, set to begin at 2:30 pm (1830 GMT).The Maryland federal judge had issued a nationwide block on the ban''s core provision concerning travel from the Muslim world, saying the orderraised the prospect of religious bias.The White House is fighting that ruling in the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals.', 3, 22, 62, 10, 1),

Davis says that there are 60 bulldozers, eight helicopters and three heavy air tankers on the scene to help fight the fire in the tiny, rural town.The wildfire started by lightning on April 6 and has since burned more than 150 square miles (389 sq. kilometers) on public lands.

At that moment, that''s the key to everything. The CEO has to act," Buffett said. "The main problem was they didn''t act when they learned about it."Still, Buffett''s support of current management and board was key to ensuring the re-election of the entire board last month.Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk said "we agree" with Buffett''s comments, and have taken "decisive actions" to fix the problems and "make things right for customers."Buffett likened the situation to Salomon Brothers Inc, where in 1991 he was installed as chairman to clean up a mess after the former chief executive failed to tell regulators a trader was submitting fake bids at Treasury auctions.Asked whether Berkshire''s decentralized structure could lead to a similar scandal, Buffett said "as we sit here, somebody is doing something wrong at Berkshire," whose units employ 367,000 people. But he said Berkshire has an internal "hotline" to flag possible misbehavior, which gets 4,000 calls a year.The meeting also included discussions about Berkshire''s succession plans, its controversial partnership with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, and whether it will start paying dividends or make a monster acquisition.Buffett has said Berkshire could have a new chief executive within 24 hours if he died or could not continue, and that nothing had changed just because he praised fewer managers than usual in his February shareholder letter.He said it may have been harder to single people out because "we have never had more good managers."But he also said it would be a "terrible mistake" if capital allocation were not the "main talent" of his successor.Buffett did lavish much praise on top insurance executive Ajit Jain, who some investors believe could be that successor, saying "nobody could possibly replace Ajit. You can''t come close."On 3G, with which Berkshire controls Kraft Heinz Co and tried to merge it with Unilever NV, Buffett acknowledged a dislike for the cost-cutting for which the Brazilian firm is known.But, he said, "it is absolutely essential to America that we become more productive, and 3G was "very good at making a business productive with fewer people."Buffett also raised the possibility Berkshire could pay its first dividend since 1967, if "reasonably soon, even while I''m around," the company had too much cash it could not reasonably deploy."It could be repurchases, it could be dividends," he said.Berkshire ended March with more than $96 billion of cash and cash-like instruments, and Munger said it could do a "$150 billion" acquisition now if it wanted.Buffett defended Berkshire''s foray into airlines, where it is a top investor in American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc.He had long disdained the industry, which had gone through many bankruptcies, but said he is confident it will not resort to "suicidally competitive" pricing strategies that could spell doom.Munger added: "You''ve got to remember railroads were a terrible business for decades and decades and decades, and then they got good." Berkshire bought the BNSF railroad in 2010.Buffett also admitted he was wrong to think International Business Machines Corp "would do better" when he started amassing 81 million shares six years ago.Berkshire recently sold about one-third of those shares even as it built a huge stake in Apple Inc, which Buffett said is more as a "consumer" company than a technology company.He also addressed criticism that Berkshire discloses too little about businesses such as aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, which it bought last year for $32.1 billion."We want you to understand what you own," he said, and "there are just a million things that are of minor importance" at Berkshire, whose market value is about $411 billion.Buffett also noted that Berkshire reported far fewer investment gains in the first quarter, which dragged on results, but said the company now has a slight preference for taking tax losses, which could lose value if Washington lawmakers reduce the 35 percent corporate tax rate.Shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that would have required Berkshire to disclose its political contributions twice a year.The annual meeting, expected to draw more than last year''s estimated 37,000 shareholders, is the main event of a weekend of events that Buffett calls "Woodstock for Capitalists."Buffett and Munger took questions after the traditional shareholder movie, and after Buffett had roamed a nearby exhibit hall featuring products from Berkshire companies.He was joined at the traditional newspaper tossing contest by friends including Microsoft Corp co-founder and Berkshire director Bill Gates and Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh.Hundreds of shareholders lined up early outside downtown Omaha''s CenturyLink Center for the meeting. Several said they got there nearly five hours before doors opened around 6:45 a.m."Every year it seems I have to come earlier," said Chris Tesari, a retired businessman from Pacific Palisades, California who said he arrived at 3:20 a.m. for his 21st meeting.

She was speaking to The Independent outside the building site in Cala Egos where the AluaSoul Mallorca Resort is taking shape.This week is the beginning of summer in the travel industry, with tour operators launching their peak-season offerings. But in scenes reminiscent of the 1970s film Carry On Abroad, hundreds of Thomson package holidaymakers who were expecting to be the first people to enjoy a newly refurbished luxury resort have been moved to other properties.Sarah Brignell, a decorator from Sevenoaks, told The Independent: "There was no one at the airport to tell us, no one on the coach to tell us. We arrived, they took our bags off, then somebody came out and shooed us straight back into the coach again. They said: ''We don''t know what we''re going to do with you yet''. Nobody was sure where we were going to go."The upmarket resort, which has been developed from two existing properties, was due to open on 1 May. Thomson tells customers: "The all-new AluaSoul Mallorca Resort promises five pools, a trio of restaurants and a spa — along with a beachfront location." When The Independent visited, dozens of workmen were at work on the property, while in ground-floor rooms beds and mattresses were upended and in their original packaging. It is now expected to open on 10 May, though Thomson is selling holidays there only from 18 May.Ms Frier said Britain''s biggest holiday company had blamed "health and safety" when she arrived on Monday morning for a holiday that had cost her £600. "Thomson told us it had failed a health and safety report on the morning we arrived. But it was a building site."But The Independent has learned that Thomson was made aware of problems before the first guests arrived. A spokesperson for the AluaSoul hotel group said: "We alerted the tour operator the night before the arrival — which was the soonest we could given the circumstances."Security guards are stationed at entrances to the AluaSoul while work continues. But the unfinished hotel has become a local curiosity among both residents of Cala Egos and holidaymakers who were due to be staying there this week.Outside the hotel grounds, Ms Frier said: "We were so disappointed, we actually asked, ''Could we fly home, we could try and salvage something and go somewhere else?'' And they said if we wanted to do that we''d have to pay our own fares, we wouldn''t be entitled to any compensation or refund of our holiday. At that stage we were nearly in tears. We just wanted to go back home. We had been travelling for 16, 17 hours. I''m an NHS nurse. This is my first holiday in a long time. And Thomson have absolutely ruined it."Eventually some alternatives were found, though of a lower standard than the AluaSoul had promised. "We''d booked fantastic rooms with a change of pillows if you wanted. Where we are is very uncomfortable. We didn''t have any hot water for the first two days. The food is questionable. It''s just not what we paid for," said Ms Brignell . "I would never, ever book Thomson again."The Independent asked for an interview with a Thomson representative on the island, but the company declined and instead issued a statement: "We are sorry the opening of the AluaSoul Majorca has been delayed until 10 May 2017. We will be contacting all customers affected directly to offer a suitable alternative free of charge and will prioritise those due to travel first. We appreciate this is disappointing so we''re closely monitoring the situation while our hotel partner completes the work to the standards that we and our customers expect."We have currently placed all customers in suitable alternative accommodation and have offered guests a gesture of goodwill due to the unexpected disruption. Our dedicated resort teams are currently on hand to assist customers with any questions or concerns that they may have."The spokesperson for AluaSoul said: "We are deeply sorry for what happened and we are working to speed up the process while guaranteeing the utmost quality standards.

Although Marine Le Pen ''s showing fell short of the worst fears of her divided and flawed adversaries, for any neo-fascistic party to score the level of support the Front National has in a leading liberal mature democracy is, by turns, appalling, shocking and terrifying. We need to regain perspective and face what is happening. There is no necessary reason to believe the far right will recede into the jumble of cranky clericalist sects that characterised French fascism. Within a short space of time, it has gone mainstream and almost grabbed power.So simply because she has become a household name across Europe and has sought to radiate a homely detoxified appeal — quite bogus, as it happens — shouldn''t make Le Pen''s achievement any less historic. Democrats across Europe and the world should acknowledge, reflect and act on the fact that she has come so close, much closer than her father two decades ago, to gaining executive authority in a global power. Whereas Jean Marie Le Pen barely added to his vote in the second round of voting when he challenged President Chirac back in 2002, his daughter has succeeded in broadening her party''s appeal markedly. Who is to say that this is the high point and the end of the story?The rise of the far right in France to unprecedented levels of popularity is like the relative triumphs of the far right in contests in Austria and the Netherlands; it points to a deep malaise in European and particularly French politics. The French are deeply pessimistic and a glance at the unemployment figures and life in the banlieues explains why. Social dislocation, radicalisation, racism, terror and the rise of extremism can, at least in part, be traced back to the long stagnation of the French economy. The EU and the unsolved weaknesses in the euro system must also share in the blame for a near political cataclysm.Elsewhere in Eastern Europe , notably in Hungary and Poland, a nasty strain of authoritarianism is taking hold. More widely still, from Trump to Erdogan and from Putin and Modi to Xi, and now also in Britain, hard nationalism is hardly in retreat.Europe is unlikely to survive as a bastion of decent liberal values if its politicians continue to fail its people, fail to listen to the discomfort about globalisation; about migration; about, above all, a lack of jobs for the young. Sometimes forgotten, that economic weakness was also the spark for the Arab Spring, and much of the tragedy that has followed it. These financial forces have driven much of today''s disjointed politics.The irony is that the very policies which could deliver economic growth are unpopular. What is needed is some leadership in the form of political figures prepared to explain to the public why their economy is broken and why the easy answers of protectionism and migration bans do more harm than good. Macron shows promise as a reforming economics minister in his time as well as a gift for salesmanship. In a TV studio he used sweet logic and some sharp sloganising to defeat the "high priestess of fear". He is smart, Macron, and he knows the stakes are high.

He pledged to open a new page for France based on hope and ``restored confidence.''''It won''t be his first experience in the challenge of reforming France.He quit his job as a banker at Rothschild to become Socialist President Francois Hollande ''s economic adviser, working for two years by Hollande''s side at the presidential palace.Then as economy minister in Hollande''s government from 2014 to 2016, he promoted a package of measures, notably allowing more stores to open on Sundays and evenings and opening up regulated sectors of the economy.Opponents on the left accused him of destroying workers'' protections. Tens of thousands of people poured into the streets for months of protests, and the government had to force the law through parliament under special powers.Last year, Macron launched his own political movement, En Marche, or In Motion, and quit the Socialist government. He promised to shake up the political landscape by appointing a government that includes new figures from business and civil society.His next challenge will be to get a parliamentary majority in an election next month to make major changes _ with no mainstream party to support him.The strong advocate of a free market and entrepreneurial spirit has called for France to focus on getting benefits from globalization rather than the protectionist policies advocated by the far right.In his political rallies, he encouraged supporters to wave both the French tricolor and the European Union flags.Le Pen, who has tapped into working-class anger at the loss of jobs and once-secure futures, called him the face of ``the world of finance,'''' the candidate of ``the caviar left.''''``I''m not under control of the banks. If that was the case, I would have kept working for them,'''' Macron answered.Macron had an unexpected test of his political skills following the first round of the vote during what became known as ``the battle of Whirlpool,'''' when Le Pen upstaged him at a Whirlpool factory in Amiens that is threatened with closure.Le Pen''s surprise appearance put him on the defensive and prompted him to meet with angry Whirlpool workers later the same day. He was whistled and booed when he first arrived. But he stood his ground, patiently debating workers in often heated exchanges about how to stop French jobs from moving abroad.In a country shaken by recent terror attacks, he pledged to boost the police and military as well as the intelligence services and to put pressure on internet giants to better monitor extremism online.To improve Europe''s security, he wants the EU to deploy some 5,000 European border guards to the external borders of the bloc''s passport-free travel zone.Macron did not campaign alone: His wife was never far away. Brigitte Macron, 24 years his senior, is his closest adviser, supporting him and helping prepare his speeches.Macron and his wife have publicly described how their unusual romance started _ when he was a student at the high school where she was teaching in Amiens in northern France. A married mother of three at the time, she was supervising the drama club. Macron, a literature lover, was a member.Macron moved to Paris for his last year of high school.``We called each other all the time. We spent hours on the phone, hours and hours,'''' Brigitte Macron recalled in a televised documentary. ``Little by little, he overcame all my resistances in an unbelievable way, with patience.''''She eventually moved to the French capital to join him and divorced. They married in 2007. Emmanuel Macron says he wants to formalize the job of first lady, adding ``she has her word to say in this.''''Following his victory speech in the courtyard of the Louvre , his wife appeared on stage by his side, with tears in her eyes.', '2017-05-08 09:32:31', 'i27.jpg', 2, 0.75, 'He promised to shake up the political landscape by appointing a government that includes new figures from business and civil society.His next challenge will be to get a parliamentary majority in an election next month to make major changes _ with no mainstream party to support him.The strong advocate of a free market and entrepreneurial spirit has called for France to focus on getting benefits from globalization rather than the protectionist policies advocated by the far right.In his political rallies, he encouraged supporters to wave both the French tricolor and the European Union flags.Le Pen, who has tapped into working-class anger at the loss of jobs and once-secure futures, called him the face of ``the world of finance,'''' the candidate of ``the caviar left.''''It won''t be his first experience in the challenge of reforming France.He quit his job as a banker at Rothschild to become Socialist President Francois Hollande ''s economic adviser, working for two years by Hollande''s side at the presidential palace.Then as economy minister in Hollande''s government from 2014 to 2016, he promoted a package of measures, notably allowing more stores to open on Sundays and evenings and opening up regulated sectors of the economy.Opponents on the left accused him of destroying workers'' protections.But he stood his ground, patiently debating workers in often heated exchanges about how to stop French jobs from moving abroad.In a country shaken by recent terror attacks, he pledged to boost the police and military as well as the intelligence services and to put pressure on internet giants to better monitor extremism online.To improve Europe''s security, he wants the EU to deploy some 5,000 European border guards to the external borders of the bloc''s passport-free travel zone.Macron did not campaign alone: His wife was never far away.If that was the case, I would have kept working for them,'''' Macron answered.Macron had an unexpected test of his political skills following the first round of the vote during what became known as ``the battle of Whirlpool,'''' when Le Pen upstaged him at a Whirlpool factory in Amiens that is threatened with closure.Le Pen''s surprise appearance put him on the defensive and prompted him to meet with angry Whirlpool workers later the same day.Brigitte Macron, 24 years his senior, is his closest adviser, supporting him and helping prepare his speeches.Macron and his wife have publicly described how their unusual romance started _ when he was a student at the high school where she was teaching in Amiens in northern France.', 3, 24, 60, 9, 1),

This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time," Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters."I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus."At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe.On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 metres and at speeds of 290-300 kilometres (180-186 miles) per hour.The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight.A letter from China''s ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a "major breakthrough" and milestone for China''s passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly.The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric, France''s Safran, Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary UTC Aerospace Systems.China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers.Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. For a TIMELINE on the C919, click"Every year we spend billions on buying planes," a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant.However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage.China''s first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year.Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus."Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how.China is aware the path won''t be easy. On a media visit on Thursday to COMAC''s C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometres from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term "hardship", "dedication" and "struggle" to meet the firm''s goals.China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards.But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia.

President Muhammadu Buhari said Saturday that some Boko Haram prisoners had been released for the freedom of the schoolgirls, but he did not give any details.The freed young women were flown Sunday by military helicopters from northeastern Nigeria to Abuja, the capital, where they were expected to meet the president."They will face a long and difficult process to rebuild their lives after the indescribable horror and trauma they have suffered at the hands of Boko Haram," said Pernille Ironside, acting representative of UNICEF Nigeria.Authorities say 113 schoolgirls remain missing of the 276 girls abducted from their boarding school in 2014. Girls who escaped said some of their classmates had died from illness. Others did not want to come home because they''d been radicalized by their captors, they said.Human rights advocates also fear some of the girls kidnapped from the Chibok boarding school were used by Boko Haram to carry out suicide bombings.In Nigeria''s capital, Abuja, anxious families were awaiting the official list of names of the 82 schoolgirls freed. Some parents have not lived long enough to see their daughters released, underscoring the tragedy of the three-year-long saga.Last year, 21 other Chibok girls were liberated in October and they have been undergoing counseling for months. It was not immediately clear whether the newest girls freed Saturday would join them.Those girls are still in government care in Abuja for medical attention, trauma counseling and rehabilitation, according to the government. Human rights groups have criticized the decision to keep the girls in custody in Abuja, nearly 900 kilometers (560 miles) from Chibok.The newly freed schoolgirls should be quickly released to their families and not be subjected to lengthy government detention, Amnesty International ''s Nigeria office said, adding that they don''t deserve to be put through a "publicity stunt" and deserve privacy.The International Committee of the Red Cross , which along with the Swiss government has mediated negotiations between Nigeria''s government and Boko Haram, said the girls soon would meet with their families.Saturday''s release marks the largest negotiated release so far of the 276 girls whose abduction in 2014 drew international attention to the threat of Nigeria''s extremists. Boko Haram has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, and has increasingly carried out attacks in neighboring countries.The mass kidnapping horrified the world and brought Boko Haram international attention. The failure of Nigeria''s former government to act quickly to free the girls sparked a global Bring Back Our Girls movement; US first lady Michelle Obama posted a photo with its logo on social media.The Bring Back Our Girls campaign said Sunday it was happy that Nigeria''s government had committed to rescuing the 113 remaining schoolgirls."We urge the president and his government to earnestly pursue the release of all our Chibok girls and other abducted citizens of Nigeria," the group said in a statement.The schoolgirls kidnapped from Chibok in 2014 are among thousands of people abducted by Boko Haram over the years.A Nigerian military official with direct knowledge of the rescue operation said the freed girls were found near the town of Banki in Borno state near Cameroon.Buhari late last year announced Boko Haram had been "crushed," but the group continues to carry out attacks in northern Nigeria and neighboring countries.

Their six-storey mansion, a sapphire''s throw from Buckingham Palace, adds 300 million pounds," it adds.Another set of India-born entrepreneurial brothers, David and Simon Reuben, who had topped the list last year have moved down to third place with a fortune of 14 billion pounds and steel tycoon Lakshmi N.Mittal is at fourth with 13. 2 billion pounds."The furnaces are roaring again in the steel industry. Mittal, 66, the largest steelmaker in the world, is feeling the effect in his bank balance and on the ''Rich List'', where his 6.1 billion increase from last year is one of the highest annual rises to date," the list reads.However, he remains a long way from his 2008 peak as the UK''s richest with then fortunes of 27.7 billion pounds. The second spot, occupied by the Hinduja brothers until 2016, has been taken over by Ukrainian businessman Len Blavatnik (15.9 billion pounds)."While many of us worried about the outcome of the EU referendum, many of Britain''s richest people just kept calm and carried on making billions," said Robert Watts, compiler of the list for the newspaper."We expected to see a chilling effect in the run-up to the EU referendum, but that simply did not materialise. A buoyant stock market usually drives the wealth of Rich Listers higher, and since last June equities have soared," he said.Among the other 40 Indian-origin super-rich include new billionaires Gujarati migrant brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, whose Euro Garages business is Europe''s largest independent fuel retailer.They are ranked 133rd on the list with a fortune of 1 billion pounds.Joining them among the new billionaires are another set of brothers - Raj, Tony and Harpal Matharu - who made 1 billion pounds last year with their Grange hotel chain in the UK.NRI industrialist Lord Swraj Paul''s business marked an 80-million-pound dip over last year, moving him down to the 194th slot, with an estimated wealth of 660 million pounds."A number of Paul''s businesses went into administration in late 2015 as a result of the steel industry crisis and his London-based Caparo Group, which includes property interests, saw its assets sink from 77 million pounds to 49.6 million pounds," the list notes.The other Indian-origin billionaires on the list include Sri Prakash Lohia at 27 with 3.97 billion pounds; metals tycoon Anil Agarwal at 60 with 2 billion pounds; Sunil Vaswani and family''s car dealerships business at 63 worth around 1.97 billion pounds; Manchester-based Simon, Bobby and Robin Arora at 65 with 1.92 billion pounds; Navin and Varsha Engineer''s pharmaceuticals business at 107 and valued at 1.2 billion pounds; and hotelier Jasminder Singh and family is ranked 128 with 1.03 billion pounds.Most of the remaining millionaires with Indian roots have made their money in a variety of industries, including Bhikhu and Vijay Patel in pharmaceuticals (675 million pounds); Jatania brothers in toiletries and property (630 million pounds); Southall Travels owners Kuljinder Bahia and family in the travel industry (420 million pounds); and Tom Singh and family in fashion (385 million pounds).Among the artists, Mumbai-born sculptor Anish Kapoor makes the list of 1,000 with 134 million pounds.He joins popular singer Adele, who is listed as Britain''s wealthiest female musician with 125 million pounds.This year''s list has been described as more diverse in composition, with more women, more people from ethnic backgrounds, and more from surprising walks of life, with egg farmers and pet food makers among the super-rich line-up.It now takes assets of 110 million pounds to break into the ranks of the richest 1,000 people in the UK.The figure in 2016 was 103 million pounds.

(AP Photo)\n\nCentrist Emmanuel Macron has vowed to “fight the divisions” in the country after recording a resounding victory over far-right rival Marine Le Pen in the French presidential runoff election. “I have heard the anger, anxiety and doubts that a large number of you expressed,” a solemn Macron said in a speech at his campaign headquarters in Paris. “I will fight with all my strength against the divisions that are undermining us,” he added.\n\nThe 39-year-old former investment banker, who became the country’s youngest-ever president, also promised to “rebuild the link between Europe and its citizens.” Soon after early projections poured in, Macron said, “A new page in our long history has turned tonight” and added that he wants the result to be that of rediscovery of hope and trust.\n\nAlso Read: French election results 2017 LIVE updates: Emmanuel Macron wins presidency, vows to ‘fight the divisions’\n\nFurther addressing a victory rally, Macron stressed on the importance of building up a parliamentary majority in order to carry out much-needed changes for France. “I will do all I can during the next five years so that no-one ever has a reason again to vote for extremes,” said Macron, referring to those who had voted for far-right Front National candidate Marine Le Pen. The president-elect now needs to focus on getting a majority in the lower house of parliament at elections in June.\n\nSupporters of French President-elect Emmanuel Macron listen to him speak during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.

(AP Photo)\n\nFrance has been reeling under terror attacks over last two years, which killed over 230 people. Determined to eradicate the menace of terrorism, the president-elect said, “France will be at the forefront of the fight against terrorism.”\n\nWith the vast bulk of votes counted, Macron has secured between 65 per cent and 66.1 per cent of the vote compared to between 33.9 per cent and 35 per cent for Le Pen. The result also followed a last-minute hacking attack on Macron, in which hundreds of thousands of emails and documents stolen from his campaign were dumped online on Friday.\n\nBuoyed over the outcome, the euro surged to its highest level since November. The election result was also a referendum on the fate of the European Union. The high-octane divisive election campaign saw both candidates spar over the country’s role in the EU. While Le Pen advocated anti-EU and anti-globalisation programme, Macron put forward a pro-EU stance.\n\nDespite conceding defeat, Le Pen claimed a “historic, massive result” for the far right in the presidential run-off. She said her National Front party needed to be overhauled in order to create a “new political force.”\n\nSupporters of French independent centrist presidential candidate, Emmanuel Macron react outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.

(APPhoto/Joshua Goodman) Rodriguez Torres, once Hugo Chavez’s longtime spy chief is calling for President Maduro to go, a crushing blow to the already beleaguered socialist leader who is facing ever-louder calls from the left to step aside. (APPhoto/Joshua Goodman)\n\nA former spy chief under the late leader Hugo Chavez is emerging as a political player in turbulent Venezuela, mistrusted by the opposition and despised by the government as he travels the country in a possible bid for the presidency. Miguel Rodriguez Torres is a longshot who hopes to offer a third way for Venezuelans weary of the country’s violence and economic woes.\n\nReviled among President Nicolas Maduro’s opponents for leading a crackdown on anti-government protesters in 2014, Rodriguez Torres has also alienated government loyalists with his sharp criticism of the socialist administration.\n\nBut he nevertheless is finding an audience among Venezuelans who have abandoned support for a government that has failed to resolve the economic crisis but still distrust the opposition.\n\nIn a recent interview, the 53-year-old Rodriguez Torres blamed Maduro for destroying Venezuela’s oil-rich economy, failing to rein in violence from pro-government militias and silencing critics. He said he is wary of the street protests launched by the president’s foes and instead preaches a message of reconciliation grounded in his evangelical Christian faith.\n\n“The rhetoric of hatred and fear that both sides have used is causing great damage to the country,” Rodriguez Torres told The Associated Press.”We have to think in the country’s interests first and not continue to see each other as enemies.”\n\nPollsters haven’t included Rodriguez Torres in their surveys yet, but his criticism of Maduro hasn’t gone unnoticed. High-ranking officials in recent weeks have accused him of treason or playing into the opposition’s hands. His aides say Venezuelan media are under pressure not to interview him and social media is filled with speculation he could be jailed for speaking out like other once loyal military bigwigs.\n\n“There’s no third way or bridges of reconciliation with FASCISM,” Vice President Tareck El Aissami said in a recent barrage of tweets directed at Rodriguez Torres, a former ally. A block from where Rodriguez Torres spoke with the AP, several hundred protesters squared off with riot police in a display of the near-daily chaos that has engulfed Venezuela’s capital the past month. More than three dozen people have died in the unrest and hundreds more have been injured.\n\nRodriguez Torres said he sees little point in the street protests. “In a crisis as deep as the one we’re facing the solution isn’t burning more things because the economy keeps falling,” he said.\n\nNot that he would be welcomed at the protests. Despite attempts to present himself as a kinder, gentler Chavista, many political opponents accuse him of violating human rights for arresting dozens of protesters as interior minister. A pallbearer at Chavez’s 2013 funeral, he is also the creator of the feared Sebin intelligence agency known for rounding up activists.\n\nOthers trying to occupy Venezuela’s almost invisible middle ground include another Chavez army acolyte, Lara state Gov. Henri Falcon, and chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who shocked the nation by saying constitutional order had been violated when the Supreme Court briefly gutted the opposition-controlled congress of its powers a few weeks ago.\n\n“Strategically, there’s a fertile playing field for moderate Chavismo,” political analyst Luis Vicente Leon said. “If they manage to get the support of independents, the opposition might find itself having to accept them out of necessity.”\n\nRodriguez Torres’ close ties to Chavismo’s military wing are what distinguish him from a growing cadre of administration critics on the left. While outwardly loyal to Maduro, many in the armed forces are believed to be unhappy with the government but fearful that if the opposition takes power they’ll lose privileges and influence accumulated during 17 years of socialist rule.\n\nRodriguez Torres was among Chavez’s earliest and closest advisers, drawn to the leader’s charismatic lectures when he studied at Caracas’ war college in the early 1980s. When Chavez led a military uprising of junior officers against President Carlos Andres Perez in 1992, Rodriguez Torres commanded 38 rebels who ambushed a much-larger military contingent guarding the presidential residence. He was jailed for two years as a ringleader of the coup attempt that launched Chavez’s ascent.\n\nAfter surviving a brief coup of his own, Chavez in 2002 named Rodriguez Torres to head the nation’s intelligence service, a post he held for much of the next decade. Maduro fired him live on state TV in 2014.

AP/PTI French President-elect Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte hold hands as they sing the Marseillaise during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017. AP/PTI\n\nWhen the world wanted to know Barack Obama’s views, after him coming back from retreat, on how Donald Trump was faring in office, he chose not to comment on specifics, but he minced no words about French election and came out strongly in support of Emmanuel Macron. According to Obama, “Macron has stood up for liberal values, he put forward a vision for the important role that France plays in Europe and around the world. And he is committed to a better future for the French people.”\n\nHe slipped in those words — liberal values and future of Europe — while endorsing Macron. French people, in their wider considerations and judgement, have voted for Macron, a 39-year-old centrist, liberal and former Rothschild investment banker. He — otherwise referred to as a candidate of unbridled globalisation and Uberisation of society by his opponents — has won the election decisively, but has left many questions unanswered with regard to liberalism, future of Europe and Globalisation.\n\nIf we are not to be enamoured by another uber cool liberal young man, adding to the list of Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama (during his time in office), there are too much to unravel in this packaged deal.\n\nFirst, what is he going to do about the nationalist sentiments whipped up by Le Pen? Do not forget she has doubled her father’s vote share from 2002, more than a third of those who voted in the second round chose her, and her support among young French is better than ever. So it is discernible that Macron is staring at a deeply divided France. With every terror attack on French soil, from small to large like that of ‘Nice’, anti-immigrant fervour will grow to see his approval rating dip, as it did for François Hollande who did not even seek reelection learning his latest rating that stood at 4 per cent in November. Every dithering response from his side on the issue of radical Islam will be considered his incompetency. His brand of liberalism will be tested on different grounds, unlike Canada and US.\n\nSecond, will he keep the EU from collapsing or be able to infuse some confidence that EU project is not going to be bust anytime soon? He has also pledged to reform EU with proposals like more integration of Eurozone with an economy minister and a parliament. This proposal will put him at odds with Germany that holds a lot of power in EU. At the same time his equations with Angela Merkel, another liberal leader, is also to be seen.\n\nThird, how will he be able to fix France’s unemployment problem that has risen to a record high? He has proposed more flexible labour laws, including changes in 35-hour-work week. He has also endorsed a 50 billion euro stimulus plan to reduce unemployment, proceeding towards a more open and competitive economy. These neoliberal policies are pragmatic and may find solutions in short term.\n\nLiberals are always tested and expected to tread on difficult paths, whereas populists find different scapegoats to shift blame on. Barack Obama tried hard but in turn gave rise to an atmosphere convenient for a populist. If Macron doesn’t do the needful at the earliest, the base that supports Le Pen will be energised and France can see a populist in 2022.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd', '2017-05-08 10:09:03', 'i37.jpg', 2, 0.65, 'AP/PTI French President-elect Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte hold hands as they sing the Marseillaise during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.French President-elect Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte hold hands as they sing the Marseillaise during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.And he is committed to a better future for the French people.”\n\nHe slipped in those words — liberal values and future of Europe — while endorsing Macron.According to Obama, “Macron has stood up for liberal values, he put forward a vision for the important role that France plays in Europe and around the world.AP/PTI\n\nWhen the world wanted to know Barack Obama’s views, after him coming back from retreat, on how Donald Trump was faring in office, he chose not to comment on specifics, but he minced no words about French election and came out strongly in support of Emmanuel Macron.', 3, 25, 60, 9, 1),

The civil war in the oil-producing country began two years after it won independence from neighbouring Sudan, when President Salva Kiir fired his deputy in 2013.\n\nThe fighting that followed split the country along ethnic lines, spurred hyperinflation and plunged parts of the nation into famine, creating Africa’s biggest refugee crisis since the Rwandan genocide in 1994. “No refugee crisis today worries me more than South Sudan,” Valentin Tapsoba, the Africa chief for the UN refugee agency UNHCR, said in a statement.\n\nIn a country of 12 million people, nearly three in every four children do not go to school, UNHCR and the U.N. children’s agency UNICF said. More than 1 million children have fled outside South Sudan while another 1 million are internally displaced. The agencies said more than a thousand children have been killed in the fighting.\n\nThe true figure may be much higher since there are no accurate death tolls available for South Sudan, one of the world’s least developed nations.

(Representational Image) The remarks in the Chinese daily came after Gen Bipin Rawat last week said India must have close ties with Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan considering the security matrix. (Representational Image)\n\nIndia should not “overly interpret” Beijing’s military development or exaggerate concerns over the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a state-run Chinese daily said today, days after the Indian Army chief suggested New Delhi carry out counter-encirclement of its “future adversaries”. The article in Global Times, a ruling Communist Party publication, said India worries that China was intentionally meddling in India-Pakistan disputes, “utilising the CPEC (which runs through the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) to grant legitimacy to Islamabad’s control over the disputed region.”\n\n“India is viewing Beijing and Islamabad as potential threats and is suspicious of Beijing’s One Belt and One Road initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC),” it said, adding that “India is exaggerating the situation”. “Beijing respects New Delhi’s sovereignty concerns, and is willing to mediate in India-Pakistan disputes, on the condition that it accords to the wishes of both India and Pakistan,” it said.\n\nThe remarks in the Chinese daily came after Gen Bipin Rawat last week said India must have close ties with Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan considering the security matrix. He said such a strategy will create a two-pronged dilemma for Pakistan, and also help tackle issues with the other difficult neighbour China, suggesting New Delhi should “carry out counter-encirclement for our future adversaries.”\n\nReferring to his remarks, the article said China advocates peaceful development and it has and will “never seek hegemony in the region.” China’s defence budget will rise by about 7 per cent this year, the lowest since 2010 and Beijing’s military development is “part of its national construction, and New Delhi should not overly interpret it,” it said. The Indian media suggests that China’s military expenditure for 2017, about 1.3 per cent of the GDP, is three times higher than that of India. “Frankly speaking, even if New Delhi’s military spending is boosted to the same level, India still lags behind its northern neighbour in its military capability. For instance, India’s development of aircraft carrier is very slow despite its early start,” it said.\n\nChina has one refurbished aircraft carrier and recently launched a homemade carrier, which was expected to take a few years to operationalise. A third carrier is reportedly under construction. The official media again urged India to join the ambition Chinese project to link China with Eurasia through the Belt and Road (B&R) initiative amid concern here about New Delhi’s apparent silence over participation in this week’s B&R summit.\n\nAt least 28 heads of state and government, including the prime ministers of Pakistan and Sri Lanka, have confirmed their participation in the summit Beijing is projecting as a global acceptance of the initiative. The article said “instead of being overly concerned about China’s rise, New Delhi should consider taking an early role in B&R initiative. China’s infrastructural initiative will not only bring economic benefits, but also fulfil India’s ambition to be an influential economic power in the region.”\n\nIt urged India to abandon its “suspicions” and adopt a pragmatic attitude towards China’s and Pakistan’s development. Meanwhile, some Chinese thinktanks warned that India’s absence at the B&R summit could affect the active participation of several countries in the region.\n\nProf Lin Minwang of Institute of International Studies of Fudan University said last week that India’s participation was important as it constitutes 80 per cent of South Asia’s economy. “If New Delhi is reluctant to get involved in China’s development plan, other countries in the region will also be impacted when participating in the B&R initiative. That’s why the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor’s (BCIM) progress is very slow,” Lin said.\n\nThe B&R initiative includes a maze of roads and port projects passing through a number of countries to connect mainland China to markets in Asia and Europe. While CPEC is highlighted as the “flagship project” of the initiative, it also includes BCIM, New Eurasian Land Bridge, China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor, China-Indochina Peninsula Economic Corridor and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-08 10:18:30', 'i33.jpg', 2, -0.65, 'The remarks in the Chinese daily came after Gen Bipin Rawat last week said India must have close ties with Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan considering the security matrix.The remarks in the Chinese daily came after Gen Bipin Rawat last week said India must have close ties with Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan considering the security matrix.(Representational Image) The remarks in the Chinese daily came after Gen Bipin Rawat last week said India must have close ties with Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan considering the security matrix.He said such a strategy will create a two-pronged dilemma for Pakistan, and also help tackle issues with the other difficult neighbour China, suggesting New Delhi should “carry out counter-encirclement for our future adversaries.”\n\nReferring to his remarks, the article said China advocates peaceful development and it has and will “never seek hegemony in the region.” China’s defence budget will rise by about 7 per cent this year, the lowest since 2010 and Beijing’s military development is “part of its national construction, and New Delhi should not overly interpret it,” it said.The article in Global Times, a ruling Communist Party publication, said India worries that China was intentionally meddling in India-Pakistan disputes, “utilising the CPEC (which runs through the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) to grant legitimacy to Islamabad’s control over the disputed region.”\n\n“India is viewing Beijing and Islamabad as potential threats and is suspicious of Beijing’s One Belt and One Road initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC),” it said, adding that “India is exaggerating the situation”.', 3, 25, 59, 9, 1),

Millions of dollars in bribes have been paid by Vietnamese timber traders to both Vietnamese and Cambodian officials, the report issued Monday by the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency alleges.\n\nIt says the Vietnamese officials are paid off in exchange for granting import quotas for the timber and Cambodians are paid to open up logging areas and smuggling routes. The logging itself in Cambodia is often illegal, taking place in protected areas such as national parks. Cambodia has banned the export of logs and since early 2016 has closed its border with Vietnam to timber as well. However, Vietnam has official quotas for such imports, which are also taxed.\n\nVietnam’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to AP’s request for comment on the report. Sear Ra, deputy chief of Cambodia’s Forestry Administration, noted that such exporting was stopped 2016, and if it had happened since then, it would have been done secretly and illegally.\n\nCambodia has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, much of it due to illegal logging and corrupt land deals. Much of the timber trade is protected by military units that profit from deals with the loggers. Vietnam’s official quotas facilitate the smuggling from Cambodia and even allows Vietnam to profit by taxing the smuggled logs, the report says.\n\n“Approximately 300,000 cubic meters of logs have been smuggled out of Cambodia and laundered in Vietnam under these quotas,” it says, estimated the kickbacks have totaled more than $13 million since the beginning of November 2016?. The watchdog says Vietnam and the European Union are expected to sign an agreement to try to ensure only legal timber is exported from Vietnam.\n\n“This is the single largest log-smuggling operation that we have seen for years,” the group’s senior forests campaigner, Jago Wadley said in a news release. “Vietnam must address this weak approach to any agreement with the EU to combat illegal logging and the associated trade.”\n\nThe report points out that the illegal trade comes as Vietnam is working hard to protect its own forests, even as Vietnam’s government “has promoted the rapid expansion of an export-oriented wood processing sector, which has become the sixth largest in the world.”\n\nIt says Vietnamese exports of wood products are projected to total $8 billion this year, while imports account for at least 80 percent of the raw materials consumed by its factories.

Australian media on Sunday published the photograph posted on social media by Sydney-born convicted terrorist Khaled Sharrouf of his youngest child. The smiling boy holds up his right index finger in a salute in front of an apparently lifeless body suspended from a cross with plastic cable ties. A sign hanging from the body said the capital crime was collaborating with Christians.\n\nSharrouf’s Muslim-convert wife Tara Nettleton took their five children from Sydney to Syria to join their father in February 2014.Nettleton died of surgery complications in September last year, but her mother Karen Nettleton continues to lobby governments for help to bring the children home.\n\nTurnbull criticized Sharrouf, 35, over the picture, saying such behavior demonstrated why Australia is committed to destroying the Islamic State movement. “The despicable conduct of Khaled Sharrouf in using his child to promote the barbaric, terrorist activities of the organization of which he is part, is almost beyond belief,” Turnbull said.\n\n“All of the children that are being exploited in this way, if they are Australian citizens, of course, would be able to return to Australia. But under the closest possible supervision,” he added.\n\nAustralian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said his officers were working with foreign partners toward prosecuting Sharrouf. The image of the child “says a lot more about Khaled Sharrouf than it does about his children,” Colvin said.\n\nSharrouf horrified the world in 2014 when he posted on social media a photograph of another son clutching the severed head of a Syrian soldier. Then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described that image as “one of the most disturbing, stomach-turning, grotesque photographs ever displayed.”\n\nThe U.S. State Department in January announced sanctions against two Australian militants, including Sharrouf. Sharrouf was among nine Muslim men accused in 2007 of stockpiling bomb-making materials and plotting terrorist attacks in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia’s largest cities.He pleaded guilty to terrorism offenses in 2009 and served less than four years in prison.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-08 10:19:00', 'i35.jpg', 2, -0.4, 'This photo published on the front page of the Monday, May 9, 2017, edition of “The Australian” newspaper shows says a 6-year-old Australian boy making an Islamic State movement salute in front of a human body hanging from a cross somewhere in the Middle East, in Canberra.(Source: AP Photo) This photo published on the front page of the Monday, May 9, 2017, edition of “The Australian” newspaper shows says a 6-year-old Australian boy making an Islamic State movement salute in front of a human body hanging from a cross somewhere in the Middle East, in Canberra.(Source: AP Photo)\n\nA 6-year-old Australian boy photographed making an Islamic State movement salute in front of a human body hanging from a cross somewhere in the Middle East was entitled to return to Australia with his siblings, Australia’s prime minister said on Monday.But such children who returned from the battlefields of Syria and Iraq would be subjected to “the closest attention” to ensure Australians were safe, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said.“The despicable conduct of Khaled Sharrouf in using his child to promote the barbaric, terrorist activities of the organization of which he is part, is almost beyond belief,” Turnbull said.“All of the children that are being exploited in this way, if they are Australian citizens, of course, would be able to return to Australia.', 3, 25, 59, 9, 1),

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File)\n\nPresident Donald Trump urged Senate Republicans on Sunday to “not let the American people down,” as the contentious debate over overhauling the US health care systems shifts to Congress’ upper chamber, where a vote is potentially weeks, if not months, away.\n\nSome senators have already voiced displeasure with the health care bill that cleared the House last week, with Republicans providing all the “yes” votes in the 217-213 count. They cited concerns about potential higher costs for older people and those with pre-existing conditions, along with cuts to Medicaid.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican whose vote will be critical to getting a bill to Trump’s desk and who voiced similar concerns, said the Senate would not take up the House bill.\n\n“The Senate is starting from scratch. We’re going to draft our bill, and I’m convinced we will take the time to do it right,” she said. Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s budget director, also said the version that gets to the president will likely differ from the House measure. Such a scenario would then force the House and Senate to work together to forge a compromise bill that both houses can support.\n\nCollins also complained that the House rushed a vote before the Congressional Budget Office could complete its cost-benefit analysis. Eager to check off a top campaign promise, Trump sought Sunday to pressure Senate Republicans on the issue.\n\n“Republican senators will not let the American people down!” Trump tweeted from his private golf course in central New Jersey, where he has stayed since late Thursday. “ObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up — it was a lie and it is dead!”\n\nTrump has said the current system is failing as insurers pull out of markets, forcing costs and deductibles to rise.\n\nThe White House on Sunday scoffed at Democratic claims that voters will punish the GOP in the 2018 elections for upending former President Barack Obama’s law. “I think that the Republican Party will be rewarded,” said Reince Priebus, Trump’s chief of staff. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California has threatened that GOP lawmakers will “glow in the dark” over their vote.\n\nThe House bill would end the health care law’s fines on people who don’t buy policies and erase its taxes on health industry businesses and higher earners. It would dilute consumer-friendly insurance coverage requirements, like prohibiting higher premiums for customers with pre-existing medical conditions and watering down the subsidies that help consumers afford health insurance.\n\nObama defended his signature achievement in Boston Sunday night while accepting the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award.\n\n“I hope that current members of Congress recall that it actually doesn’t take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful, already comfortable, already influential,” he said. “But it does require some courage to champion the vulnerable, and the sick and the infirm.”\n\nMajor medical and other groups, including the American Medical Association, opposed the House bill. Democrats are also refusing to participate in any effort to dismantle Obama’s law, while some Republican senators — Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — object to cutting Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor and disabled.\n\nThe ACA expanded Medicaid with extra payments to 31 states to cover more people. The House bill halts the expansion, in addition to cutting federal spending on the program, which Trump’s health chief argued is flawed and dictates too much from Washington.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Tom Price argued that states will get more freedom to experiment with the program and make sure that people who rely on Medicaid get the care and coverage they need.\n\n“There are no cuts to the Medicaid program,” Price insisted Sunday, adding that resources are being doled out to allow states greater flexibility. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio questioned what would happen to the mentally ill, drug addicts and people with chronic illnesses under the changes proposed for Medicaid.\n\n“They are going to be living in the emergency rooms again,” potentially driving up health care costs, Kasich predicted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., plans to move forward under special procedures that allow legislation to pass with a simple majority vote, instead of the 60 usually required for major bills in the Senate. That means McConnell can afford to lose just two senators; Vice President Mike Pence would vote to break a 50-50 tie in his constitutional role as vice president of the Senate.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., appeared resigned to the legislative reality that the bill he unveiled with great fanfare, after years of Republican pledges to replace what’s become known as “Obamacare,” will be altered as part of a “multistage process.”\n\n“We think we need to do even more support for people who are older and also more support for people with pre-existing conditions,” Ryan acknowledged. “The Senate will complete the job.”\n\nA political group with ties to House Republican leadership, American Action Network, said Sunday it was buying $500,000 in television time to promote the Republican health care bill. The ad will focus on key elements of the American Health Care Act and thank Ryan and fellow Republicans for “keeping their promise” on the health care issue, the group said.\n\nOn the other side, a health advocacy group is launching a six-figure advertising campaign this week targeting 24 Republican House members who voted to repeal Barack Obama’s health care law. Save My Care says the campaign will include a mix of TV and digital advertising, costing more than a half million dollars.\n\nAmong those being targeted: Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, the moderate Republican who helped revive the bill by authoring an amendment on pre-existing conditions. Some House lawmakers have been challenged by the public over the House vote.\n\nConservative Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, drew boos Friday at a public meeting for his response to a constituent who said the House bill tells people on Medicaid to “accept dying. Labrador responded: “That line is so indefensible. Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care.” The comment traveled quickly on social media.\n\nCollins and Ryan appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” Price was on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and on CNN’s “State of the Union” with Kasich, while Mulvaney was interviewed on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Priebus was on “Fox News Sunday.”\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-08 10:20:23', 'i38.jpg', 2, 0.15, '(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File) FILE – In this Friday, March 24, 2017, file photo, protesters gather across the Chicago River from Trump Tower to rally against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, in Chicago.FILE – In this Friday, March 24, 2017, file photo, protesters gather across the Chicago River from Trump Tower to rally against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, in Chicago.The ad will focus on key elements of the American Health Care Act and thank Ryan and fellow Republicans for “keeping their promise” on the health care issue, the group said.Sen.

(Source: AP Photo/Kim Kwang Hyon, file)\n\nNorth Korea said on Sunday it has detained another US citizen on suspicion of “hostile acts” against the state, which would make him the fourth American to be held by the isolated country amid heightened diplomatic tensions with Washington. Kim Hak Song, who worked for the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, was detained on Saturday, the North’s KCNA news agency said.\n\n“A relevant institution of the DPRK detained American citizen Kim Hak Song on May 6 under a law of the DPRK on suspension of his hostile acts against it,” KCNA said. DPRK is short for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s official name. A third US citizen, Kim Sang Dok, who was associated with the same school, was detained in late April for hostile acts, according to the North’s official media. The US State Department said it is aware of the latest reported detention.\n\n“The security of US citizens is one of the department’s highest priorities. When a US citizen is reported to be detained in North Korea, we work with the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang,” a State Department official said in an emailed statement, declining to provide further details for privacy reasons. The reported detention comes as tensions on the Korean peninsula run high, driven by harsh rhetoric from Pyongyang and Washington over the North’s pursuit of nuclear weapons in response to what it says is a threat of US-instigated war.\n\nThe Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) was founded by evangelical Christians and opened in 2010. Its students are generally children of the country’s elite. The volunteer faculty of PUST, many of whom are evangelical Christians, has a curriculum that includes subjects once considered taboo in North Korea, such as capitalism. The college is an unlikely fit in a country that has been condemned by the United States for cracking down on freedom of religion.\n\nKim, who manages the school’s experimental farm at the college of agriculture and life sciences, was detained on route by train from Pyongyang to China’s border town of Dandong, the university’s co-founder Chan-Mo Park told Reuters. Park declined to comment further.\n\nA message by Kim Hak Song dated February 2015 on the website of a Korean-Brazilian church in Sao Paulo said he was a Christian missionary planning to start an experimental farm at PUST and was trying to help the North Korean people learn to become self-sufficient. No further details were available about the circumstances related to the arrests of the two men associated with the college. A spokesman for PUST was not immediately available for comment.\n\nNorth Korea, which has been criticized for its human rights record, has in the past used detained Americans to extract high-profile visits from the United States, with which it has no formal diplomatic relations. The other two Americans already held in North Korea are Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old student, and Kim Dong Chul, a 62-year-old Korean-American missionary.\n\nWarmbier was detained in January 2016 and sentenced to 15 years hard labour for attempting to steal a propaganda banner. Two months later, Kim Dong Chul was sentenced to 10 years hard labour for subversion.

(68, 'Who is France’s President-elect Emmanuel Macron? Everything you need to know', 'France President-elect Emmanuel Macron. France President-elect Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe 39-year old Centrist independent candidate Emmanuel Macron is set to become France’s youngest President after defeating far-right opposition candidate Marine Le Pen in a closely fought election. Former finance minister of the country, Macron, never held elected office before. Here is everything you need to know about France’s new President-elect:\n\nEarly Beginnings\n\nBorn on 21 December 1977 in the city of Amiens in Northern France to a family of doctors, Macron decided to stray away from a career in medicine, becoming the only one from his family to do so. He went on to study philosophy at Nanterre University. Later he studied in two of the most reputed colleges in the country, Institute of Political Science (Sciences Po) and École nationale d’administration (ENA), before starting a career in investment banking at Rotschild & Cie. in 2012.\n\nMacron, who will replace Francois Hollande to take the reigns of presidency, quit his career as an investment banker to work as Hollande’s economic minister. He worked for the socialist government for two years, but then revolted by starting his own political movement, ‘En Marche’. During his time as finance minister, Macron caught the eye of opposition with his promotion of measures allowing more stores to open on Sundays and opening up regulated sectors of the economy. He was accused of destroying worker’s protection. While launching his political movement, Macron promised to shake up the political landscape in the country.\n\nUnconventional marriage\n\nThroughout his Presidential campaign, Macron was supported by his wife Brigitte Macron, who is 24 years older to him. At 63, Brigitte helped her husband in preparing his speeches and stood tall alongside him at every public event. The couple have made the story of their unusual romance public. Macron met Brigitte when he was a student in Amiens. Brigitte, a mother of three at the time, was also the supervisor of the drama club of which he was a part of.\n\nFrench President-elect Emmanuel Macron holds hands with his wife Brigitte during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus)\n\n“We called each other all the time. We spent hours on the phone, hours and hours… Little by little, he overcame all my resistances in an unbelievable way, with patience,” Brigitte said in a televised documentary. The couple eventually got married in 2007 after she moved to Paris with him.\n\nMacron’s beliefs\n\nMacron has painted himself as “neither of the Left or the Right” and has constantly maintained he stands for “France”. After winning the elections, Macron vowed he will work to “rebuild the relationship between Europe and the people that make it.” In his book Revolution, Macron described himself as both “Left-wing” and a “liberal”, and has mostly stayed on the Left side of social issues. A strong advocate of a free market and entrepreneurial spirit, Macron, throughout his election campaign stressed on the benefits one can reap of globalisation. He also spoke against protectionist policies advocated by his far right opponent Le Pen.\n\nFrance has seen a surge in terror attacks in last few years. To tackle the threat, Macron has pledged he will boost police, military forces and intelligence services in the country. He has also stressed on the threat posed by online extremism and has vowed he will put pressure on internet giants to better monitor cyber space for genuine threats.\n\nMacron also focused on improving the security throughout Europe and wants the EU to deploy 5,000 border guards at external borders of the bloc’s passport-free travel zone. He is a supporter of European Union, and encouraged his supporters to wave European Union flag at his political rallies.\n\n(With inputs from AP, AFP)\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd', '2017-05-08 10:21:22', 'i40.jpg', 2, 0.65, '(AP Photo/Thibault Camus) French President-elect Emmanuel Macron holds hands with his wife Brigitte during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.French President-elect Emmanuel Macron holds hands with his wife Brigitte during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.France President-elect Emmanuel Macron.France President-elect Emmanuel Macron.Brigitte, a mother of three at the time, was also the supervisor of the drama club of which he was a part of.', 3, 24, 60, 9, 1),

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum Sunday, May 7, 2017, in Boston. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\nFormer President Barack Obama, in his first public comments about the ongoing debate over his signature health care plan, implored members of Congress on Sunday to demonstrate political courage even if it goes against their party’s positions. Obama briefly returned to the spotlight as he accepted the annual John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award at JFK’s presidential library in Boston. The award is named for a 1957 Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Kennedy that profiled eight U.S. senators who risked their careers by taking principled though unpopular positions.\n\nIn his approximately 30-minute speech after accepting the award, Obama steered clear of partisan attacks and never mentioned his successor, President Donald Trump, who has often criticized the previous administration and has worked to undo many of Obama’s initiatives, including the Affordable Care Act. The former president recalled members of Congress who voted to pass the ACA during his presidency, only to lose their seat in later elections.\n\n“They had a chance to insure millions,” he said. “But this vote could also cost them their seats, perhaps end their political careers.”\n\nObama made no direct reference to Thursday’s House vote to dismantle much of the health care law, but declared that while it did not take courage to help the rich and powerful, it does require courage to help the sick and vulnerable.\n\n“It is my fervent hope and the hope of millions … such courage is still possible, that today’s members of Congress regardless of party are willing to look at the facts and speak the truth, even when it contradicts party positions,” said Obama, whose appeal seemed to focus on wavering Republicans. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, one of the few Republicans to attend the dinner, told reporters the Senate would write its own version of the legislation and he did not expect the House bill to survive intact.\n\nThe former president focused much of his address on the legacy of President Kennedy, as the library prepared to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth later this month. Obama noted the Kennedys had long advocated for health care reform, and in particular, the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died of brain cancer before passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAmong the guests who made their way down the red carpet into the library for the event were representatives of the Kennedy family, members of Congress, former Obama staffers and celebrities including former late-night talk show host David Letterman. Former Vice President Joe Biden and former Secretary of State John Kerry also were in attendance.\n\nUS Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a Massachusetts Democrat, said Obama earned the award by meeting many challenges that faced him during his presidency.\n\n“It’s about understanding the challenges we face as a country and as a planet and mustering the political will to do what is right even if what is right at that moment isn’t necessarily popular,” said Kennedy, a harsh critic of the GOP health overhaul plan.\n\nCaroline Kennedy, JFK’s daughter who served as Ambassador to Japan, and Jack Schlossberg, Kennedy’s grandson, presented the award. Schlossberg, 24, and planning to attend Harvard Law School, said Obama inspired him the way an earlier generation was inspired by his grandfather.\n\n“Without Barack Obama, I might still be sitting on my couch, eating Doritos and watching sports,” he said.\n\nWhile the former president has steered away from any involvement in U.S. affairs during his early months out of office, he forayed into the French political debate last week by posting a message of endorsement for centrist presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, who defeated his far right rival Marine Le Pen in Sunday’s election.\n\nOn Monday, Obama travels to Italy to give a keynote address on climate change and food security at Tuesday’s Seeds and Chips Global Food Innovation Summit in Milan.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-08 10:22:04', 'i41.jpg', 2, 1, '(AP Photo/Steven Senne) Former President Barack Obama speaks after being presented with the 2017 Profile in Courage award during ceremonies at the John F.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler) French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen leaves after speaking at her election day headquarters Sunday, May 7, 2017 in Paris. (AP Photo/Michel Euler)\n\nMarine Le Pen on Sunday put a brave face on her crushing defeat to Emmanuel Macron in Sunday’s presidential election, pledging to overhaul her far-right party and turn it into the main opposition to France’s new centrist leader. Analysts said she looked set to maintain her grip on the National Front (FN), despite criticism from some party members, including her own relatives, over her campaign.\n\nDespite losing to Macron by around 35 percent to 65, Le Pen did nearly twice as well as her father did when he reached the second round of the election in 2002, but fell short of the 40 percent party officials had said would be a success. The anti-EU, anti-immigration party will now focus on the mid-June parliamentary elections, although Le Pen recognised that the party needs far-reaching change.\n\nIn a brief address to supporters who booed Macron’s victory and then sadly chanted France’s La Marseillaise anthem when the news of Le Pen’s defeat emerged, the 48-year-old far-right leader said the National Front (FN) “must deeply renew itself.” “I will propose starting this deep transformation of our movement in order to make a new political force,” she added.\n\nIt was unclear at this stage what impact the overhaul would have on policy. FN deputy head Florian Philippot said the new party would not be called the National Front, the party’s name for more than four decades. The brand is well known in France and abroad but is very much associated in voters’ minds with her maverick father Jean-Marie, who has been convicted several times for incitement to racial hatred.\n\nWhile Le Pen did not address the question of the party’s name, she said she aimed to reach out beyond the current FN and reconstruct the French political landscape around a “patriots” versus “globalists” divide. But achieving that goal will be no easy task.\n\nNicolas Dupont-Aignan, the leader of a small nationalist party who backed Le Pen after he attracted just under 5 percent of votes in the first round, and whom Le Pen had promised to appoint as her prime minister if she won, said on Sunday he would not join her new party and would instead present his own candidates in the parliamentary ballot, independently of the FN.\n\n“If even the man who should have been her prime minister says he won’t be part of it, the question is, whatever the name of the party, who will be there and what its policies will be?” said Jean-Yves Camus, a researcher who specialises in the far-right.\n\nThe conservative The Republicans party hopes to rebound in the parliamentary elections. Its officials, and most of its supporters, are seen sticking to their party rather than joining the FN, analysts said.\n\nAlthough the National Front can count on a loyal base, it only has two seats in the current lower house of parliament and a poll last week predicted the party would win only around 15-25 seats in the June elections. The OpinionWay-SLPV Analytics poll of 535 of the 577 constituencies found Macron’s En Marche! (Onwards!) party would emerge as the largest group, followed by the conservatives.\n\n“LESSONS TO BE LEARNED”\n\nIn a party where the Le Pen family has always called the shots, Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie and her niece Marion Marechal-Le Pen, a rising star and FN lawmaker, said Marine Le Pen’s campaign had not been convincing enough and had been undermined by its position on the euro. A majority of voters oppose ditching the euro, which is at the heart of the FN’s economic programme. While Le Pen in the last days of the campaign appeared to soften her position on its timetable, Marechal-Le Pen said that came too late.\n\n“There are clearly lessons to be learned,” she said on France 2 television. “We clearly didn’t manage to get this election to be understood as a referendum for or against France, a referendum for or against immigration … for or against the European Union as we know it.” Last Wednesday’s televised candidates’ debate, in which Le Pen constantly attacked Macron and seemed at times uneasy on economic issues, was also cited by analysts and supporters alike as a reason for the defeat.\n\n“The debate was a failure,” FN supporter Jean-Francois Perier, a 76-year old pensioner, said at Sunday’s FN election gathering. “I just hope now we will rebound for the parliamentary elections.” Despite the criticism, analysts said Le Pen’s leadership was unlikely to be challenged.\n\n“There is a lot of disappointment but no one contests her leadership,” said researcher Sylvain Crepon, of the university of Tours. He said that would remain true even if the legislative elections were also a disappointment. “Her grip on the party is simply too strong,” he said. Researcher Camus said the only possible opponent at this stage, Marechal-Le Pen, who has had a series of public disagreements with her aunt over the years, did not seem to want to lead any challenge. Top party officials agreed.\n\n“It’s thanks to Marine Le Pen that we got this historic score for our party, it is out of the question that she wouldn’t be with us to wage that new battle,” said the head of the FN Youths, Gaetan Dussausaye, while adding that the party overhaul would mean fresh faces and party structures.\n\n“There is today a new opposition leader and it’s Marine Le Pen,” top party official Jean-Lin Lacapelle told reporters.

(Onwards!) party would emerge as the largest group, followed by the conservatives.\n\n“LESSONS TO BE LEARNED”\n\nIn a party where the Le Pen family has always called the shots, Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie and her niece Marion Marechal-Le Pen, a rising star and FN lawmaker, said Marine Le Pen’s campaign had not been convincing enough and had been undermined by its position on the euro. A majority of voters oppose ditching the euro, which is at the heart of the FN’s economic programme. While Le Pen in the last days of the campaign appeared to soften her position on its timetable, Marechal-Le Pen said that came too late.\n\n“There are clearly lessons to be learned,” she said on France 2 television. “We clearly didn’t manage to get this election to be understood as a referendum for or against France, a referendum for or against immigration … for or against the European Union as we know it.” Last Wednesday’s televised candidates’ debate, in which Le Pen constantly attacked Macron and seemed at times uneasy on economic issues, was also cited by analysts and supporters alike as a reason for the defeat.\n\n“The debate was a failure,” FN supporter Jean-Francois Perier, a 76-year old pensioner, said at Sunday’s FN election gathering. “I just hope now we will rebound for the parliamentary elections.” Despite the criticism, analysts said Le Pen’s leadership was unlikely to be challenged.\n\n“There is a lot of disappointment but no one contests her leadership,” said researcher Sylvain Crepon, of the university of Tours. He said that would remain true even if the legislative elections were also a disappointment. “Her grip on the party is simply too strong,” he said. Researcher Camus said the only possible opponent at this stage, Marechal-Le Pen, who has had a series of public disagreements with her aunt over the years, did not seem to want to lead any challenge. Top party officials agreed.\n\n“It’s thanks to Marine Le Pen that we got this historic score for our party, it is out of the question that she wouldn’t be with us to wage that new battle,” said the head of the FN Youths, Gaetan Dussausaye, while adding that the party overhaul would mean fresh faces and party structures.\n\n“There is today a new opposition leader and it’s Marine Le Pen,” top party official Jean-Lin Lacapelle told reporters.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter Workers build a brick wall across the front of a restaurant in a hutong alley in Beijing, China May 5, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nThe Chinese capital is sanitizing its ancient hutong alleyways, home to millions of migrants workers and thousands of small businesses, bulldozing illegal constructions and forcing shops, bars and tiny courtyard restaurants to relocate or go under. As part of guidelines unveiled in April, authorities have started to brick in doors of properties along the narrow passageways, many of which date back to the 13th century. They have also cracked down on illegal shopfronts to restore the original facades.\n\nTraditionally a courtyard property has only one entrance. That means shops on a property are not allowed to create or maintain additional entrances. On top of that, authorities have stopped issuing new commercial licences in Beijing’s most ambitious clean-up of the hutongs, where some buildings are crumbling and unsafe. And current licences will not be renewed. The municipal government says it is trying to eradicate an “urban disease”.\n\nBusiness owners have been seen taking photos of their shopfronts and bidding them goodbye. For some, they are saying farewell to the old city. “The most appealing part of Beijing is about to disappear,” said Titi, the owner of a clothing store in Fangjia hutong, famous for its bars and vintage stores.\n\nShopkeepers in Fangjia complained that they had not been given enough time before their stores were bricked in. Some had no choice but to hold flash clearance sales during a recent three-day public holiday to get rid of stock. Residents and businesses are given from five to 15 days to rectify unapproved construction before “the authorities enforce mandatory demolition with no obligation to compensate any losses”, according to notices posted on the walls of many hutongs.\n\n“I am not against government policy, but you (the authorities) have to give us some time to take care of our business,” said the owner of a Fangjia Mexican snack bar.\n\nPRE-OLYMPIC CLEAN-UP\n\nThe winding, bustling hutongs with their tell-tale tiled roofs have been central to Beijing life since the government allowed private businesses to set up shop in the late 1980s in the hope of stimulating the economy and creating jobs. They have been targeted before. More than 1,000 courtyard properties in dozens of hutongs were renovated or destroyed in the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics in a gentrification process which drew much criticism from admirers of the old city.\n\nNow, under a three-year plan to clean up 1,674 hutongs, the municipal government is targeting illegal construction. That’s more than two-thirds of all existing hutongs, most of them in congested central Beijing. It was unclear what will happen to properties that are restored but left empty. Most hutong properties are leased to migrant workers.\n\nOfficial data shows the number of migrant workers has risen fivefold over the past 18 years, peaking at 8.2 million in 2015. That growth has slowed due to new population controls which aim to cap the number of people at 23 million by 2020. Beijing’s population now is about 21.7 million. While there is no official word linking the revamp to efforts to curb population growth, some migrant workers, who run everything from convenience stores to hair salons to dumpling restaurants and even a British-themed pub, are convinced they are a target.\n\n“There is no single high-rise building that was not built by migrant workers,” construction worker An said. “Now the city doesn’t need us to build more buildings, so we are being kicked out.”\n\nPLAYING “HARDBALL”\n\nAn and his wife may have to move back to eastern Shandong province after their kitchen was torn down. “What can we do? We’ve to go back home if the authorities are determined to kick us out,” said An, who declined to give his full name for fear of repercussions. An and his wife have rented a 10 square-metre (100 square-foot) room in Xilou hutong for three years. Their children and grandchildren visit every day, but they never stay overnight as the room is too small. The hutong revamp is overseen by Beijing’s new mayor, Cai Qi, who said city authorities should “dare to play hardball” when taking down unapproved projects and unsafe construction.\n\nThe press department at the Beijing municipal government office could not immediately comment on the current hutong revamp. The Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce did not reply to a fax seeking comment. In Wenchang hutong near Beijing’s financial centre, the owner of a pancake shop, who gave her name as Su, is worried about the future. “My store is of the same age those of fancy buildings nearby, but mine has to retire early,” said Su, who left central Henan province for Beijing more than two decades ago.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-08 10:35:04', 'i79.jpg', 2, -0.1, 'REUTERS/Thomas Peter Workers build a brick wall across the front of a restaurant in a hutong alley in Beijing, China May 5, 2017.Workers build a brick wall across the front of a restaurant in a hutong alley in Beijing, China May 5, 2017.“The most appealing part of Beijing is about to disappear,” said Titi, the owner of a clothing store in Fangjia hutong, famous for its bars and vintage stores.More than 1,000 courtyard properties in dozens of hutongs were renovated or destroyed in the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics in a gentrification process which drew much criticism from admirers of the old city.PRE-OLYMPIC CLEAN-UP\n\nThe winding, bustling hutongs with their tell-tale tiled roofs have been central to Beijing life since the government allowed private businesses to set up shop in the late 1980s in the hope of stimulating the economy and creating jobs.', 3, 24, 60, 9, 1),

(REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay)\n\nThe head of Germany’s armed forces has called for an inspection of all army barracks after investigators discovered Nazi-era military memorabilia in a garrison, broadening a scandal about right-wing extremism among soldiers. The discovery at a barracks in Donaueschingen, in southwest Germany, was made in an investigation that began after similar Nazi-era items were found in the garrison of an army officer arrested on suspicion of planning a racially motivated attack. As a result, General Inspector Volker Wieker ordered a wider search of barracks.\n\n“The General Inspector has instructed that all properties be inspected to see whether rules on dealing with heritage with regard to the Wehrmacht and National Socialism are being observed,” a Defence Ministry spokesman said. Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said the military must root out right-wing extremism.\n\n“We must now investigate with all due rigor and with all candour in the armed forces,” the minister told broadcaster ARD on Sunday evening. “The process is starting now, and more is sure to come out. We are not through the worst of it yet.” Displaying Nazi items such as swastikas is punishable under German law, although possession of regular Wehrmacht items is not. Von der Leyen said last week, however, she would not tolerate the veneration of the Wehrmacht in today’s army, the Bundeswehr.\n\nVon der Leyen said the arrested officer – who had falsely registered as a Syrian refugee – had likely worked with others to squirrel away 1,000 rounds of ammunition, but the chief federal prosecutor was still investigating the matter. The suspect’s goal, she said, had likely been to carry out an attack and then pin the blame on migrants.\n\nVon der Leyen said the military had not taken the threat of right-wing extremism seriously enough but that the Bundeswehr had also been busy dealing with other issues such as the rise of Islamic State and increasing military threats from Russia. “You have to have a reason to dig deeper,” she said, noting that 18 members of the armed forces had in fact been dismissed for right-wing extremist views since 2012.\n\nVon der Leyen provoked criticism from a soldiers’ group and some lawmakers last week when she criticised what she called “weak leadership” in the military after the officer’s arrest on suspicion of planning a racist attack. On Thursday, she apologised for the tone of her criticism of the military over its handling of the racism case, as she sought to contain a divisive row in the buildup to national elections in September.

(Source: AP Photo) French President-elect Emmanuel Macron gestures during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017. (Source: AP Photo)\n\nRipping up France’s political map, French voters elected independent centrist Emmanuel Macron as the country’s youngest president Sunday, delivering a resounding victory to the unabashedly pro-European former investment banker and dashing the populist dream of far-right rival Marine Le Pen. Macron, who had never run for office before, celebrated with thousands of jubilant, flag-waving supporters outside the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday night.\n\nThe European anthem “Ode to Joy” played as he strode out to address the swelling crowd. “France has won!” he said. “Everyone said it was impossible. But they do not know France!”\n\nMarine Le Pen, his far-right opponent in the runoff, quickly called the 39-year-old Macron to concede after voters rejected her “French-first” nationalism by a large margin. Le Pen’s performance punctured her hopes that the populist wave which swept Donald Trump into the White House and led Britain to vote to leave the EU would also carry her to France’s presidential Elysee Palace.\n\nSupporters of French independent centrist presidential candidate, Emmanuel Macron react outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.

(Source: AP Photo)\n\nMacron told the Louvre crowd that the Le Pen vote was one of “anger, disarray.” I will do everything in the five years to come so there is no more reason to vote for the extremes,”he said.Earlier, in a solemn televised victory speech, Macron vowed to heal the social divisions exposed by France’s acrimonious election campaign.\n\n“I know the divisions in our nation that led some to extreme votes. I respect them,” he declared, unsmiling.”I know the anger, the anxiety, the doubts that a large number of you also expressed. It is my responsibility to hear them.”\n\nThe result wasn’t close: With about 90 percent of votes counted, Macron had 64 percent support. Le Pen had 36 percent about double what Jean-Marie Le Pen, her father and co-founder of their National Front party, achieved at the same stage in the 2002 presidential election.\n\nFrench far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen leaves after speaking at her election day headquarters Sunday, May 7, 2017 in Paris.

(Source: AP Photo)\n\nMacron’s victory strengthens France’s place as a central pillar of the European Union, and marked the third time in six months following elections in Austria and the Netherlands that European voters shot down far-right populists who wanted to restore borders across Europe. The election of a French president who champions European unity could also strengthen the EU’s hand in its complex divorce proceedings with Britain.\n\nParisians lined the streets outside Macron’s campaign headquarters to see his motorcade whisk him away to the Louvre party. His wife, Brigitte, joined him on stage after his address.\n\nMacron said he understood that some voters backed him reluctantly, simply to keep out Le Pen and her National Front party, which has a long history of anti-Semitism and racism. “I know that this is not a blank check,” he said. “I know about our disagreements. I will respect them.”\n\nAfter the most closely watched and unpredictable French presidential campaign in recent memory, many voters rejected the runoff choices altogether _ casting blank or spoiled ballots in record numbers Sunday. Police sprayed tear gas and detained dozens of protesters holding running demonstrations through eastern Paris after the election results came out.\n\nCongratulatory messages poured in from abroad. Trump tweeted congratulations on what he called Macron’s “big win” and said he looked forward to working with the new French leader. Macron has said he wants continued intelligence-sharing with the United States and cooperation at the United Nations and hopes to persuade Trump not to pull the U.S. out of a global accord fighting climate change.\n\nFrench President-elect Emmanuel Macron holds hands with his wife Brigitte during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.

(Source: AP Photo)\n\nGermany’s foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, laced his welcome for Macron with a warning to the French, saying: “If he fails, in five years Mrs. Le Pen will be president and the European project will go to the dogs.”\n\nMacron becomes not only France’s youngest-ever president but also one of its most unlikely. Until now, modern France had been governed either by the Socialists or the conservatives, but both of their candidates were eliminated before the runoff. “France has sent an incredible message to itself, to Europe and the world,” said Macron ally Francois Bayrou, tipped among his possible choices for prime minister.\n\nUnknown to voters before his turbulent 2014-16 tenure as France’s pro-business economy minister, Macron took a giant gamble by quitting Socialist President Francois Hollande’s government to run as an independent. His startup political movement _ optimistically named “En Marche! (In Motion)” caught fire in just one year, harnessing voters’ hunger for new faces and new ideas.\n\n“I’m so happy, it feels so good! I lived the election of Donald Trump in New York, and now finally, after Brexit, after Trump, populism has been beaten in France,” Macron supporter Pierre-Yves Colinet said at the Louvre party. “Today, I’m proud to be French.”\n\nDespite her loss, Le Pen’s advancement to the presidential runoff for the first time marked a breakthrough for the 48-year-old and underscored a growing acceptance of her anti-immigration, France-first nationalism. Le Pen immediately turned her focus to France’s upcoming legislative election in June, where Macron will need a working majority to govern effectively. Le Pen said her “historic and massive” score turned her party into “the leading opposition force against the new president’s plans.”\n\n“I call on all patriots to join us,” Le Pen said. “France will need you more than ever in the months ahead.” Her supporters at a National Front election night gathering in Paris put on a brave face.\n\n“Now we enter combat,” said Didier Roxel, a National Front legislative candidate. Le Pen said she won 11 million votes, which would be her party’s highest-ever electoral score.\n\nMacron and Le Pen offered polar-opposite visions: Le Pen’s closed borders against Macron’s open ones; his commitment to free trade ran against her proposals to protect the French from global economic competition and immigration. Her desire to free France from the EU and the shared euro currency contrasted with his argument that both are essential for the future of Europe’s third-largest economy.\n\nMacron also got lucky in the campaign. One of his most dangerous opponents, conservative former Prime Minister Francois Fillon, was vilified after allegations that his family benefited from cushy taxpayer-funded jobs for years. Fillon is facing charges in the case.\n\nOn the left, the Socialist Party imploded, its candidate abandoned by voters who wanted to punish Hollande, France’s most unpopular president since World War II. Hollande himself decided not to run again.\n\nMacron takes charge of a nation that, when Britain leaves the EU in 2019, will become the EU’s only member with nuclear weapons and a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council.\n\nBut the vote also showed that France’s 67 million people are deeply divided, riven by anxieties about terrorism and chronic unemployment, worried about the cultural and economic impact of immigration and fearful of France’s ability to compete against giants like China and Google.\n\nMacron has promised a France that would stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin but that also would seek to work with Putin on fighting the Islamic State group, whose extremists have claimed multiple attacks in France since 2015. France has been in a state of emergency since then and 50,000 security forces were out to safeguarded Sunday’s vote.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-08 10:36:37', 'i83.jpg', 2, 0.75, '(Source: AP Photo) French President-elect Emmanuel Macron holds hands with his wife Brigitte during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.(Source: AP Photo) French President-elect Emmanuel Macron gestures during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.French President-elect Emmanuel Macron holds hands with his wife Brigitte during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.French President-elect Emmanuel Macron gestures during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.(Source: AP Photo) Supporters of French independent centrist presidential candidate, Emmanuel Macron react outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.', 3, 24, 60, 9, 1),

The coordinated crackdown comes amid warming ties between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Philippine counterpart Rodrigo Duterte, who has made illegal gambling the third front in his all-out war on crime, after drugs and corruption.\n\nIn their first joint exercise, Philippine and Chinese authorities cracked a transnational cyber gambling operation in April, shutting four illegal websites run out of the Philippines, arresting 99 people and freezing more than 1,000 bank accounts, China’s Public Security Bureau said.\n\nMartini Cruz, chief of the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation’s cyber-crime division, told Reuters authorities were preparing further raids in May targeting illegal betting and online fraud originating in the Philippines and targeted at Chinese gamblers. “We have been visited by Chinese police to crack down on these illegal gambling operators. They are also targeting possible fugitives who have made our country a sanctuary,” Cruz said.\n\nSo far, the crackdown has not targeted proxy betting, which is permitted in licensed casinos in the Philippines and has contributed to a boom in VIP revenues. Casinos in the country raked in nearly $3 billion in overall revenue last year. The practice, in which a gambler outside the casino gives instructions to an agent via a live stream or online platform, allows people to bet anonymously and can allow players to escape the attention of authorities in their home countries. Industry executives have said increased scrutiny could impact the lucrative proxy business in the Philippines particularly if it continues to ramp up ahead of the official opening of Japanese slot machine tycoon Kazuo Okada’s new $2.4 billion casino in the capital Manila in July. PROXY GAMBLING\n\nWhile proxy gambling is banned in Singapore and in Macau, the world’s largest gambling hub, it operates in a legal grey area in the Philippines and officials tend to tread cautiously when discussing the subject. Andrea Domingo, the head of the Philippines gaming regulator, PAGCOR, told Reuters she was not familiar with proxy betting.\n\n“It is allowed in the casinos. I am not very conversant about it,” she said. Chinese law forbids citizens from gambling online and at home. The Public Security Bureau has made repeated statements since March that transnational cyber gambling is harmful to the country’s economic security, image and stability. Yet proxy betting is growing at such a pace in the Philippines that Suncity, the top junket operator bringing in high rollers from China, told Reuters in April that 80 percent of its business comes from proxy gambling and 20 percent from customers traveling to casinos for live table games.\n\nBen Lee, managing partner of IGAMIX Management and Consulting in Macau, said the latest directives this year from China were clear warning signs. “China warning specifically that they would crack down again on foreign casinos should be heeded by all, especially those operating in the online space,” he said. The proxy business in the Philippines is mainly facilitated by Macau junket operators who bring high rollers into the casinos’ opulent VIP parlours, either in person or via proxies. The junkets take on the risk for casinos, settling all credit and debt for the players in Macau, Hong Kong and China via their own internal banking networks. In a VIP area in a Manila casino, Chinese and Korean nationals wearing earpieces shuffle from table to table after a series of bets, carrying rectangular white plastic trays containing gaming chips and smartphones.\n\nA Macau-based executive whose company operates proxy gambling in the Philippines said there was little concern on the ground in Manila as the practice is licensed by PAGCOR. “To play the game in China is legal online, it is not happening in China,” he said, explaining that the casinos install video screening so punters can see the play. For now, proxy gambling continues to boost the VIP coffers in the Philippines with mega casinos Solaire and City of Dreams reporting double digit VIP volume growth in the first quarter this year. The casinos do not report proxy betting figures.\n\nHowever, executives in Macau familiar with the VIP boom in the Chinese territory prior to Xi’s crackdown on corruption and tighter junket regulation cautioned against relying too strongly on the method. “Proxy betting in the Philippines is a ripe target for China,” said a senior casino executive based in Macau who was not allowed to be named due to company policy.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-08 10:37:32', 'i86.jpg', 2, -0.875, 'In their first joint exercise, Philippine and Chinese authorities cracked a transnational cyber gambling operation in April, arresting 99 people and freezing more than 1,000 bank accounts (Representational Image) In their first joint exercise, Philippine and Chinese authorities cracked a transnational cyber gambling operation in April, arresting 99 people and freezing more than 1,000 bank accounts (Representational Image)\n\nChina and the Philippines have joined forces to tackle illegal gambling, part of Beijing’s broader campaign to curb illicit capital outflows and a pledge by Manila to weed out unscrupulous operators from the country’s booming gaming industry.In their first joint exercise, Philippine and Chinese authorities cracked a transnational cyber gambling operation in April, shutting four illegal websites run out of the Philippines, arresting 99 people and freezing more than 1,000 bank accounts, China’s Public Security Bureau said.So far, the crackdown has not targeted proxy betting, which is permitted in licensed casinos in the Philippines and has contributed to a boom in VIP revenues.PROXY GAMBLING\n\nWhile proxy gambling is banned in Singapore and in Macau, the world’s largest gambling hub, it operates in a legal grey area in the Philippines and officials tend to tread cautiously when discussing the subject.Yet proxy betting is growing at such a pace in the Philippines that Suncity, the top junket operator bringing in high rollers from China, told Reuters in April that 80 percent of its business comes from proxy gambling and 20 percent from customers traveling to casinos for live table games.', 3, 24, 60, 9, 1),

(Source: AP Photo) French President-elect Emmanuel Macron gestures during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017. (Source: AP Photo)\n\nEmmanuel Macron was elected French president on Sunday with a business-friendly vision of European integration, defeating Marine Le Pen, a far-right nationalist who threatened to take France out of the European Union. The centrist’s emphatic victory, which also smashed the dominance of France’s mainstream parties, will bring huge relief to European allies who had feared another populist upheaval to follow Britain’s vote to quit the EU and Donald Trump’s election as U.S. president. With virtually all votes counted, Macron had topped 66 percent against just under 34 percent for Le Pen – a gap wider than the 20 or so percentage points that pre-election surveys had suggested.\n\nEven so, it was a record performance for the National Front, a party whose anti-immigrant policies once made it a pariah, and underlined the scale of the divisions that Macron must now try to heal.\n\nAfter winning the first round two weeks ago, Macron had been accused of behaving as if he was already president; on Sunday night, with victory finally sealed, he was much more solemn.\n\n“I know the divisions in our nation, which have led some to vote for the extremes. I respect them,” Macron said in an address at his campaign headquarters, shown live on television.\n\n“I know the anger, the anxiety, the doubts that very many of you have also expressed. It’s my responsibility to hear them,” he said. “I will work to recreate the link between Europe and its peoples, between Europe and citizens.” Later he strode alone almost grimly through the courtyard of the Louvre Palace in central Paris to the strains of the EU anthem, Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, not breaking into a smile until he mounted the stage of his victory rally to the cheers of his his partying supporters.\n\nHis immediate challenge will be to secure a majority in next month’s parliamentary election for a political movement that is barely a year old, rebranded as La Republique En Marche (“Onward the Republic”), in order to implement his programme.\n\nEUROPE DEFENDED\n\nOutgoing president Francois Hollande, who brought Macron into politics, said the result “confirms that a very large majority of our fellow citizens wanted to unite around the values of the Republic and show their attachment to the European Union”. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, told Macron: “I am delighted that the ideas you defended of a strong and progressive Europe, which protects all its citizens, will be those that you will carry into your presidency”. Macron spoke by phone with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he hopes to revitalise the Franco-German axis at the heart of the EU, saying he planned to visit Berlin shortly.\n\nTrump also tweeted his congratulations on Macron’s “big win”, saying he looked forward to working with him. The euro currency, which had been rising for two weeks as the prospect receded that France would elect an anti-EU president, topped $1.10 in early Asian trading for the first time since the U.S. elections.\n\n“Fading political risk in France adds to the chance that euro zone economic growth can surprise to the upside this year,” said Holger Schmieding, analyst at Berenberg Bank. The 39-year-old former investment banker, who served for two years as economy minister under Hollande but has never previously held elected office, will become France’s youngest leader since Napoleon.\n\nLe Pen, 48, said she had also offered her congratulations. But she defiantly claimed the mantle of France’s main opposition in calling on “all patriots to join us” in constituting a “new political force”. Her tally was almost double the score that her father Jean-Marie, the last far-right candidate to make the presidential runoff, achieved in 2002, when he was trounced by the conservative Jacques Chirac. Her high-spending, anti-globalisation ‘France-first’ policies may have unnerved financial markets but they appealed to many poorer members of society against a background of high unemployment, social tensions and security concerns.\n\nRESHAPING THE LANDSCAPE\n\nDespite having served briefly in Hollande’s deeply unpopular Socialist government, Macron managed to portray himself as the man to revive France’s fortunes by recasting a political landscape moulded by the left-right divisions of the last century. “I’ve liked his youth and his vision from the start,” said Katia Dieudonné, a 35-year-old immigrant from Haiti who brought her two children to Macron’s victory rally. “He stands for the change I’ve wanted since I arrived in France in 1985 – openness, diversity, without stigmatising anyone … I’ve voted for the left in the past and been disappointed.”\n\nMacron’s team successfully skirted several attempts to derail his campaign – by hacking its communications and distributing purportedly leaked documents – that were reminiscent of the hacking of Democratic Party communications during Hillary Clinton’s U.S. election campaign.\n\nAllegations by Macron’s camp that a massive computer hack had compromised emails added last-minute drama on Friday night, just as official campaigning was ending. While Macron sees France’s way forward in boosting the competitiveness of an open economy, Le Pen wanted to shield French workers by closing borders, quitting the EU’s common currency, the euro, radically loosening the bloc and scrapping trade deals. When he moves into the Elysee Palace after his inauguration next weekend, Macron will become the eighth – and youngest – president of France’s Fifth Republic. Opinion surveys taken before the second round suggest that his fledgling movement, despite being barely a year old, has a fighting chance of securing the majority he needs.\n\nHe plans to blend a big reduction in public spending and a relaxation of labour laws with greater investment in training and a gradual reform of the unwieldy pension system.\n\nA European integrationist and pro-NATO, he is orthodox in foreign and defence policy and shows no sign of wishing to change France’s traditional alliances or reshape its military and peacekeeping roles in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nNEW GENERATION\n\nHis election also represents a long-awaited generational change in French politics that have been dominated by the same faces for years. He will be the youngest leader in the current Group of Seven (G7) major nations and has elicited comparisons with youthful leaders past and present, from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to British ex-premier Tony Blair and even late U.S. president John F. Kennedy.\n\nBut any idea of a brave new political dawn will be tempered by an abstention rate on Sunday of around 25 percent, the highest this century, and by the blank or spoiled ballots submitted by 12 percent of those who did vote. Many of those will have been supporters of the far-left maverick Jean-Luc Melenchon, whose high-spending, anti-EU, anti-globalisation platform had many similarities with Le Pen’s.\n\nMelenchon took 19 percent in coming fourth in the first round of the election, and pointedly refused to endorse Macron for the runoff. France’s biggest labour union, the CFDT, welcomed Macron’s victory but said that the National Front’s score was still worryingly high.\n\n“Now, all the anxieties expressed at the ballot by a part of the electorate must be heard,” it said in a statement. “The feeling of being disenfranchised, of injustice, and even abandonment is present among a large number of our citizens.” The more radical leftist CGT union called for a demonstration on Monday against “liberal” economic policies.\n\nLike Macron, Le Pen will now have to work to try to convert her presidential result into parliamentary seats, in a two-round system that has in the past encouraged voters to vote tactically to keep her out. She has worked for years to soften the xenophobic associations that clung to the National Front under her father, going so far as to expel him from the party he founded.\n\nOn Sunday night, her deputy Florian Philippot distanced the movement even further from him by saying the new, reconstituted party would not be called “National Front”.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-08 10:38:38', 'i88.jpg', 2, 0.55, '“I will work to recreate the link between Europe and its peoples, between Europe and citizens.” Later he strode alone almost grimly through the courtyard of the Louvre Palace in central Paris to the strains of the EU anthem, Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, not breaking into a smile until he mounted the stage of his victory rally to the cheers of his his partying supporters.(Source: AP Photo) French President-elect Emmanuel Macron gestures during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.French President-elect Emmanuel Macron gestures during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.EUROPE DEFENDED\n\nOutgoing president Francois Hollande, who brought Macron into politics, said the result “confirms that a very large majority of our fellow citizens wanted to unite around the values of the Republic and show their attachment to the European Union”.“He stands for the change I’ve wanted since I arrived in France in 1985 – openness, diversity, without stigmatising anyone … I’ve voted for the left in the past and been disappointed.”\n\nMacron’s team successfully skirted several attempts to derail his campaign – by hacking its communications and distributing purportedly leaked documents – that were reminiscent of the hacking of Democratic Party communications during Hillary Clinton’s U.S. election campaign.', 3, 24, 60, 9, 1),

Determined to eradicate the menace of terrorism, the president-elect said, “France will be at the forefront of the fight against terrorism.”\n\nWith the vast bulk of votes counted, Macron has secured between 65 per cent and 66.1 per cent of the vote compared to between 33.9 per cent and 35 per cent for Le Pen. The result also followed a last-minute hacking attack on Macron, in which hundreds of thousands of emails and documents stolen from his campaign were dumped online on Friday.\n\nBuoyed over the outcome, the euro surged to its highest level since November. The election result was also a referendum on the fate of the European Union. The high-octane divisive election campaign saw both candidates spar over the country’s role in the EU. While Le Pen advocated anti-EU and anti-globalisation programme, Macron put forward a pro-EU stance.\n\nDespite conceding defeat, Le Pen claimed a “historic, massive result” for the far right in the presidential run-off. She said her National Front party needed to be overhauled in order to create a “new political force.”\n\nSupporters of French independent centrist presidential candidate, Emmanuel Macron react outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.

I look forward to working closely with [him] to further strengthen India-France ties,” Modi said on Twitter.\n\nUS president Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Theresa May and German chancellor Angela Merkel also wished Macron on his thumping victory.\n\nMacron, however, will face a mounting challenge to implement his programme while trying to unite a fractured and demoralised country. He is aiming to enact his domestic agenda of cutting state spending, easing labour laws, boosting education in deprived areas and extending new protections to the self-employed.\n\nWith many analysts being sceptical about Macron’s ability to win a majority with En Marche candidates alone, he might have to form a coalition of lawmakers committed to his agenda. In addition, his economic agenda, particularly plans to weaken labour regulations to fight stubbornly high unemployment, are likely to face fierce resistance from trade unions and his leftist opponents.\n\nWith inputs from AFP, Reuters.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd', '2017-05-08 10:39:01', 'i89.jpg', 2, 0.15, '(AP Photo) Supporters of French President-elect Emmanuel Macron listen to him speak during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.Supporters of French President-elect Emmanuel Macron listen to him speak during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.(AP Photo) French President-elect Emmanuel Macron gestures during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.French President-elect Emmanuel Macron gestures during a victory celebration outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.(Source: AP Photo) Supporters of French independent centrist presidential candidate, Emmanuel Macron react outside the Louvre museum in Paris, France, Sunday, May 7, 2017.', 3, 24, 60, 9, 1);

Marine Le Pen, his far-right opponent in the presidential runoff, quickly called the 39-year-old Macron to concede defeat after voters rejected her “French-first” nationalism by a large margin.\n\nRipping up France’s political map, French voters elected independent centrist Emmanuel Macron as the country’s youngest president Sunday, delivering a resounding victory to the unabashedly pro-European former investment banker and strengthening France’s place as a central pillar of the European Union.\n\nAt a victory party outside the Louvre Museum in Paris, Macron supporters roared with delight at the news, waving red, white and blue tricolor flags. The jubilant crowd swelled to thousands as the night wore on.\n\nMarine Le Pen, his far-right opponent in the presidential runoff, quickly called the 39-year-old Macron to concede defeat after voters rejected her “French-first” nationalism by a large margin. Macron, in a solemn televised victory speech, vowed to heal the social divisions exposed by France’s acrimonious election campaign and bring “hope and renewed confidence” to his country.\n\n“I know the divisions in our nation that led some to extreme votes. I respect them,” he declared, unsmiling. “I know the anger, the anxiety, the doubts that a large number of you also expressed. It is my responsibility to hear them.”\n\nThe result wasn’t even close: With two-thirds of votes counted, Macron had 62 percent support, with pollsters projecting a final score of 65 percent when all votes were counted.\n\nLe Pen’s projected 35 percent score dashed her hopes that the populist wave which swept Donald Trump into the White House and led Britain to vote to leave the EU would also carry her to France’s presidential Elysee Palace.\n\nMacron’s victory marked the third time in six months following elections in Austria and the Netherlands that European voters shot down far-right populists who wanted to restore borders across Europe. The election of a French president who championed European unity could also strengthen the EU’s hand in its complex divorce proceedings with Britain.\n\n“A new page in our long history is opening tonight. I want it to be one of hope and renewed confidence,” Macron said.\n\nMany French voters backed him reluctantly, not because they agreed with his politics but simply to keep out Le Pen and her National Front party, fearing its long anti-Semitic and racist history.\n\nAfter the most closely watched and unpredictable French presidential campaign in recent memory, many voters rejected the runoff choices altogether. Pollsters projected that French voters cast blank or spoiled ballots in record numbers Sunday.\n\nCongratulatory messages poured in from abroad. Trump tweeted congratulations on what he called Macron’s “big win” and said he looked forward to working with the French leader. Macron has said he wants continued intelligence-sharing with the United States and cooperation at the United Nations and hopes to persuade Trump not to pull the U.S. out of a global accord fighting climate change.\n\nGermany’s foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, laced his welcome for Macron with a warning to the French, saying: “If he fails, in five years Mrs. Le Pen will be president and the European project will go to the dogs.”\n\nMacron becomes not only France’s youngest-ever president but also one of its most unlikely. Until now, modern France had been governed either by the Socialists or the conservatives. Both Macron and Le Pen upended that right-left tradition.\n\n“France has sent an incredible message to itself, to Europe and the world,” said Macron ally Francois Bayrou, tipped among his possible choices for prime minister.\n\nUnknown to voters before his turbulent 2014-16 tenure as France’s pro-business economy minister, Macron took a giant gamble by quitting Socialist President Francois Hollande’s government to run as an independent in his first campaign.\n\nHis startup political movement optimistically named “En Marche! (Forward)” caught fire in just one year, harnessing voters’ hunger for new faces and new ideas.\n\n“I’m so happy, it feels so good! I lived the election of Donald Trump in New York, and now finally, after Brexit, after Trump, populism has been beaten in France,” said Pierre-Yves Colinet, a joyous Macron supporter at the Louvre victory party. “Today, I’m proud to be French.”\n\nDespite her loss, Le Pen’s advancement to the runoff for the first time marked a breakthrough for the 48-year-old and underscored a growing acceptance of her fierce anti-immigration, France-first nationalism. She had placed third in the 2012 presidential vote.\n\nLe Pen immediately turned her focus to France’s upcoming legislative election in June, where Macron will need a working majority to govern effectively. Le Pen said her “historic and massive” score turned her party into “the leading opposition force against the new president’s plans.”\n\n“I call on all patriots to join us,” Le Pen said. “France will need you more than ever in the months ahead.”\n\nHer supporters at a National Front election night gathering in Paris put on a brave face.\n\n“Now we enter combat,” said Didier Roxel, a National Front legislative candidate.\n\nLe Pen said she got 11 million votes. If confirmed, that would be double the score of her father, National Front co-founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, at the same stage in the 2002 presidential election.\n\nMacron and Le Pen’s polar-opposite visions presented France’s 47 million registered voters with the starkest possible choice. Le Pen’s closed borders faced off against Macron’s open ones; his commitment to free trade ran against her proposals to protect the French from global economic competition and immigration. Her desire to free France from the EU and the shared euro currency contrasted with his argument that both are essential for the future of Europe’s third-largest economy.\n\nAs well as capitalizing on voter rejection of the left-right monopoly on power, Macron also got lucky. One of his most dangerous opponents, conservative former Prime Minister Francois Fillon, was hobbled by allegations that his family benefited from cushy taxpayer-funded jobs for years.\n\nOn the left, the Socialist Party imploded, its candidate abandoned by voters who wanted to punish Hollande, France’s most unpopular president since World War II. Hollande himself decided not to run again.\n\nMacron takes charge of a nation that, when Britain leaves the EU in 2019, will become the EU’s only member with nuclear weapons and a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council.\n\nBut the vote also showed that France’s 67 million people are deeply divided, riven by anxieties about terrorism and chronic unemployment, worried about the cultural and economic impact of immigration and fearful of France’s ability to compete against giants like China and Google.\n\nMacron has promised a France that would stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin but that also would seek to work with Putin on fighting the Islamic State group, whose extremists have claimed or inspired multiple attacks in France since 2015.\n\nFrance has been in a state of emergency since then and 50,000 security forces safeguarded Sunday’s vote.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-08 10:39:48', 'i90.jpg', 2, 0.35, 'Marine Le Pen, his far-right opponent in the presidential runoff, quickly called the 39-year-old Macron to concede defeat after voters rejected her “French-first” nationalism by a large margin.Marine Le Pen, his far-right opponent in the presidential runoff, quickly called the 39-year-old Macron to concede defeat after voters rejected her “French-first” nationalism by a large margin.Marine Le Pen, his far-right opponent in the presidential runoff, quickly called the 39-year-old Macron to concede defeat after voters rejected her “French-first” nationalism by a large margin.“Today, I’m proud to be French.”\n\nDespite her loss, Le Pen’s advancement to the runoff for the first time marked a breakthrough for the 48-year-old and underscored a growing acceptance of her fierce anti-immigration, France-first nationalism.Le Pen said her “historic and massive” score turned her party into “the leading opposition force against the new president’s plans.”\n\n“I call on all patriots to join us,” Le Pen said.', 3, 24, 60, 9, 1),

(AR Productions)\n\nThe town of Shingal was the cultural and religious centre for Yazidis, the minuscule minority that was subjected to an ethnic cleansing by marauding Islamic State terrorists. IS captured the city in 2014, thousands of Yazidi men were killed, an equal number of women raped and forced into sexual slavery.\n\nThis haunting film tracks a refugee family in a makeshift camp in Turkey, trying to make sense of the devastation even as the head of the Havind family tries to rescue his daughter Viyan from IS through bribes paid to a chain of intermediaries.\n\n“The quest for their daughter Viyan, for me, it’s a metaphor for the quest for the Yazidi identity with their religious capital destroyed and half a million population displaced. It’s very important to redefine what’s left for the Yazidi people,” Rallis said during an interview.\n\nThe pacing of the film is almost languid, with dramatic tension offered by episodes where Viyan describes her trauma, and those of other women who have been kidnapped, over the phone to her father.

That effort has claimed some RBSS members and caused many to flee to Turkey and Europe, while several still remain to counter the IS narrative of urban utopia with horrifying images of brutality and of women and children clamouring for food.\n\nIn City Of Ghosts, Matthew Heineman’s observational filming is augmented with footage that its members still in Raqqa are smuggling out.

Thus, part of the film has “amazing footage coming out of Raqqa, of life under the Caliphate”, Heineman said.\n\nThe other, equally important, is the stress the members who have fled face, from their comrades and family members being executed by IS to being targets for assassination themselves.\n\n“I think the film is obviously a megaphone for what they are doing with their work,” Heineman said.\n\nA still from the documentary City of Ghosts, directed by Academy Award-nominated Matthew Heineman.

It features members of the White Helmets, a volunteer brigade that tries to rescue those trapped under the rubble left by bombing runs by fighter jets of the Assad regime or its Russian backers.\n\nDirected by Feras Fayyad, who was born just outside Aleppo, the film begins with one White Helmet, Khaled, staring at the sky and saying, “(Syrian President) Bashar (al-Assad) keeps us looking up all the time; we can’t look down any more.”\n\nDeath from above.

(133, 'Terror, feudal politics and delays could hit China-Pak corridor, says Chinese scholar', 'Multiple security issues and political uncertainties mark the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a top Chinese scholar has said, adding opinion is divided on the viability of the project both in the short and long term.\n\nThe CPEC, whose cost has been projected at more than $46 billion, cuts through Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK), leading to protests from India over the issue of sovereignty.\n\nDespite New Delhi’s concerns, China has pumped billions of dollars into the corridor, making it a flagship and prestige project under President Xi Jinping’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since he announced it in 2013.\n\nBut is the CPEC turning into a corridor of uncertainty?\n\n“China and Pakistan share the belief that economic development can help stabilise Pakistan and improve its domestic security situation. However, China also recognises that the security, political, and cultural risks and uncertainties facing the economic corridor cannot be overlooked,” Shi Zhiqin, executive dean of the newly opened One Belt, One Road Strategic Institute in Beijing, wrote in a paper.\n\nTerrorism, political infighting and attempts by Pakistani political parties to divide the “CPEC cake” have already caused substantial delays, Shi wrote in the widely circulated paper titled “The Benefits and Risks of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor”.\n\nIn an interview to Hindustan Times, Shi explained: “From the economic point, is it (CPEC) worth it? There is division in China. Some say there is great potential economic benefit and some disagree. This is a long-term project. In the short-term, we can’t see much benefit. But in the long-term, maybe it is beneficial.”\n\nTerrorism is among the multiple problems facing the corridor and “there have been many terrorist attacks in Pakistan,” he said. In the paper, he noted that Chinese nationals have been attacked or killed in Pakistan.\n\n“The first of these risks is terrorism, which has long affected Pakistan’s internal security and stability. Although Pakistan has worked hard to strike at religious extremism and terrorist activities, its problems with terrorism have not substantially improved in recent years...Indeed, there already have been numerous occasions when Chinese engineers working in Pakistan have been attacked or even lost their lives,” Shi wrote.\n\n“In May 2016, for instance, engineers in Karachi were attacked by Sindh separatists. Fortunately, no Chinese personnel were wounded or killed. Then in September, Baloch rebels killed at least two Chinese engineers and injured many others. Moreover, several large-scale terrorist attacks in Balochistan have killed dozens of people, which shows that the security situation in this province where China has key projects is far from ideal,” he wrote.\n\nShi also wrote that the Pakistan government’s commitment to provide security to the CPEC can work only in the short-term.\n\n“However, over time, it will become more difficult for Pakistan to guarantee the security of the CPEC’s growing transportation networks, which will require increasing investments of security personnel and material support.”\n\nPakistan’s volatile domestic politics is another worry, according to Shi.\n\n“The country’s political system has never been particularly stable. Political power oscillates between military and civilian leaders...On the other hand, Pakistan’s traditional political culture, which is almost feudal in nature, also continues to play an important role,” Shi wrote in the paper, which he co-authored for Tsinghua University with another scholar, Lu Yang.\n\nShi added: “Powerful families based in different provinces, such as the Bhuttos and the Sharifs, have typically held political power. Behind the party politics are local interests groups associated with these families.”\n\nPakistan’s political parties and pressure groups, he wrote, have also tried to influence the routes that the CPEC should take. “Various parties within Pakistan have disagreed a lot about how CPEC transportation routes should be mapped out. The competing parties are primarily interested in how the cake should be divided, so to speak,” he wrote.\n\nShi added that since the initiative was first presented in 2013, the debate over which route the CPEC will follow has caused substantial delays. “The construction of the corridor has just begun. It is expected that competition among Pakistan’s domestic political groups will continue to affect its future implementation,” he wrote.\n\n“China and Pakistan have taken positive measures to help set up the CPEC for success. Nevertheless, Pakistan’s domestic situation will be decisive. Until the country’s political and security conditions turn a corner, it will be difficult to judge the corridor’s future prospects. For China, this means neutrality, strategic patience, and caution are needed as the construction of this grand initiative continues.”\n\nPositives for CPEC from the report\n\n* Pakistan is working to improve its overall economy by constructing energy projects and other infrastructure, to create employment opportunities for its populace, and to improve its governance.\n\n* The corridor aims to enhance the well-being of people across Pakistan and bring long-term prosperity and stability.\n\n* The CPEC will not only serve as a roadway that connects point A to point B—the initiative is designed to do more and aims to facilitate multisectoral economic cooperation in finance, trade, energy, and industry.\n\n* The successful completion of Pakistan’s 2013 election and the smooth transition of power was the first time in the country’s history that a civilian government was able to serve its full term.

Those domains include onedrive-en-marche.fr and mail-en-marche.fr.\n\n“If indeed driven by Moscow, this leak appears to be a significant escalation over the previous Russian operations aimed at the U.S. presidential election, expanding the approach and scope of effort from simple espionage efforts towards more direct attempts to sway the outcome,” Kremez said.\n\nFrance is the latest nation to see a major election overshadowed by accusations of manipulation through cyber hacking.\n\nUS intelligence agencies said in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacking of parties tied to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to influence the election on behalf of Republican rival Donald Trump.\n\nOn Friday night as the #Macronleaks hashtag buzzed around social media, Florian Philippot, deputy leader of the National Front, tweeted “Will Macronleaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?”\n\nMacron spokesman Sylvain Fort, in a response on Twitter, called Philippot’s tweet “vile”.\n\nEn Marche! said the documents only showed the normal functioning of a presidential campaign, but that authentic documents had been mixed on social media with fake ones to sow “doubt and misinformation”.\n\nBen Nimmo, a UK-based security researcher with the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council think tank, said initial analysis indicated that a group of U.S. far-right online activists were behind early efforts to spread the documents via social media. They were later picked up and promoted by core social media supporters of Le Pen in France, Nimmo said.\n\nThe hashtag #MacronLeaks was first spread by Jack Posobiec, a pro-Trump activist whose Twitter profile identifies him as Washington D.C. bureau chief of the far-right activist site Rebel TV, according to Nimmo and other analysts tracking the election.\n\nPosobiec could not immediately be reached to comment by Reuters.\n\n“You have a hashtag drive that started with the alt-right in the United States that has been picked up by some of Le Pen’s most dedicated and aggressive followers online,” Nimmo told Reuters.\n\nAlt-right refers to a loose-knit group of far-right activists known for their advocacy of extremist ideas, rejection of mainstream conservatism and disruptive social media tactics.', '2017-05-08 11:10:24', 'i140.jpg', 2, -0.75, '“The En Marche!En Marche!The presidential election commission said in a statement that it would hold a meeting on Saturday after Macron’s campaign informed it about the hack and publishing of the data.Leading French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron’s campaign said on Friday it had been the target of a “massive” computer hack that dumped its campaign emails online one and a half days before voters choose between the centrist and his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen.On April 26, the team said it had been the target of attempts to steal email credentials dating back to January, but that the perpetrators had failed to compromise any campaign data.', 3, 24, 60, 9, 1),

The state, which has six of the 35 Naxal-affected districts in the country, has recorded a decline of 60 per cent in violent incidents, from 316 to 129, by Naxals between 2011 and 2016, Kumar said in a review meeting on left wing extremism (LWE) organised by the Home Ministry in New Delhi.\n\nKumar said the the Congress-led UPA government had introduced some schemes for capacity enhancement of security forces and to address local disparity in the LWE affected states like Special Infrastructure Scheme, Integrated Action Plan and Security Related Expenditure.\n\n“These schemes produced good results. Since last year the SIS and IAP schemes have been discontinued and ironically this happened when we were hoping that the government would further strengthen these schemes and enhance resources,” Kumar said. He said the stoppage of funding in these scheme has adversely affected the undergoing developmental works undertaken, specially, under these schemes in affected districts.\n\nKumar also chided the Centre for stopping the funding for three counter-insurgency and anti-terrorist schools with effect from 2015-16. The schools were started by the UPA government in 2010 to make state police ready for anti-LWE operations.\n\n“It is ironical that on one hand capacity building and training of security forces are being emphasised, while on the other the central government has already stopped funding to training centres,” Kumar said. He said the funds for the “modernisation of police force”, to equip the state police with technology, training and modern gear to face threats like LWE, have been reduced by the Centre.\n\nThe chief minister said it has been felt that the structuring and scope of the scheme should be expanded to meet new challenges. “On the contrary, the government as a change in policy has reduced funding in plan component of the MPF schemes. From year 2000-2001 to 2014-15 the central government provided funding under MPF to the tune of Rs 40 crore annually, on an average. Subsequently it was reduced to Rs 25 crore,” he said.\n\nKumar also said that for a state like Bihar the ratio of Centre and state funding should be 90:10 and not 60:40. He claimed that Bihar had requested the Home Ministry for the deployment of one helicopter in Bihar but they turned down the proposal and instead asked the state to use the helicopter deployed in Jharkhand as and when need arises. He said the state even suggested to the MHA that a helicopter could be provided on a wet lease basis under Security Related Expenditure scheme, which can be expedited by the Centre.\n\n“This fight against LWE to maintain internal security is joint responsibility of the state and the central governments, but all expenses are borne by the state. Therefore, it is our request that this expenditure should jointly be shared by both,” Kumar said on the funding for deployment of central forces for anti-Naxal operations.\n\nHe said under the federal structure of country, the Centre cannot relegate itself to a mere reviewing role by throwing the ball in the court of states for taking effective action to neutralise the LWE threat which has emerged as a challenge to “internal security”. “Financial grants will need to be continued for the schemes initiated earlier…and their size and scope will need to be broadened.

Express Photo by Partha Paul\n\nSix days after People for Animal (PFA) chairman Naresh Kadyan filed a police complaint alleging government officials of going slow over Mewat biryani samples collected in 2016, Hisar’s Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences on Monday clarified that the samples sent to the university belonged to ‘cow/oxen’. The Haryana police now say that it would act on a complaint filed by Kadyan after receiving a formal report from the university. Kadyan alleges that the “cows were slaughtered to get beef biryani unlawfully without any permit.” “The meat of cow and oxen is referred as beef. It means that all seven samples have been found beef-positive. The accused may be punished with up to seven years imprisonment for the offence,” says Kadyan.\n\nThe biryani samples were collected from seven traders in 2016 suspecting that these were product of beef. On August 24, 2016, the officials of the veterinary department had sent the samples to the university. On September 6, 2016, the university had mentioned that“all seven samples are from cattle species”. However, the veterinary department officials wanted more clarity on the lab test results. “ …it is clarified that the term ‘cattle’ mentioned in this report refers to cow/oxen,” mentioned the university in a letter to the incharge of Govt Veterinary Hospital, Firozpur Jhirka, (Mewat) on Monday. When contacted by The Indian Express, Dr Y Singh, head of university’s Department of Veterinary Public Health & Epidemiology, confirmed that they have sent a clarification to the veterinary officials.\n\nSoon after coming to know about the development, Kadyan, who is pursuing the issue since long, said that now the police should lodge an FIR without any delay. On May 2, Kadyan had filed a police complaint to the CM window as well to the Firozepur Jhirka police station after accessing the September 2016 lab report ‘unofficially’. He accused the state government officials of going slow in taking action against the biryani traders. Kadyan had alleged that even after the university provided a report to a veterinary surgeon of Firozepur Jhirka, the surgeon did not hand it over to the police for action.\n\nHowever, Kadyan now says that now they won’t insist on action against the Veterinary Surgeon as the university has sent a clarification only on Monday. Last week, SHO of Firozepur Jhirka Police police station Shamsher Singh had told The Indian Express that there was no clarity in the report, in which “the word cattle was mentioned and it may refer to other animals”. However, Kadyan has been insisting since the beginning that the “cattle” refers to cow. Firozepur Jhirka’s Deputy Superintendent of Police, Yadram said, “We have not received report of the university yet. We will lodge an FIR after receiving the same.” Alleging negligence in handling the entire issue, Kadyan claimed that the samples of Biryani were carried out without Food and Safety Officer and health department officers whose presence is mandatory in such matters.\n\nKadyan is the same person who had recently claimed that the two suspects in the recent attack on three men transporting buffaloes in Delhi were trained by him — and that he had been conducting such “training” since 2005, allegedly on instructions from Maneka Gandhi, now the Union Minister for Women and Child Development.\n\nWhat the Haryana law says?\n\nThe Haryana Gauvansh Sanrakshan and Gausamvardhan Act, 2015 had made the cow slaughter punishable with rigorous imprisonment up to 10 years, and a fine of Rs 1 lakh.

(Representational Image) Maintaining that the solution to the Naxal problem did not lie in any “silver bullet”, Singh said everyone must analyse the current strategy, thinking, preparation and resources. (Representational Image)\n\nChoking financial resources was the “most basic mantra” in the fight against Maoists, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday and asked affected states to “take ownership” of the anti-Naxal operation.\n\nInaugurating a meeting of chief ministers and top officials of 10 Maoist affected states, the minister said there was need to frame an integrated strategy to deal with the guerrillas.\n\nEconomic resources, he said, play an important role in any war — only when money is available is it possible to buy, eat, drink and possess ammunition and weapons. “Therefore, choking the financial resources of the left wing extremists is the most basic mantra in this fight,” he said at the meeting being held two weeks after an ambush in Sukma, Chhattisgarh, in which 25 paramilitary personnel were killed.\n\nDeclaring all out war, Singh stressed on “unity of purpose” and spoke of a unified coordination and command to counter left wing extremists (LWE). Along with strategic command, unified command was required at the operational and tactical level — besides intelligence sharing which was equally important.\n\n“We have to bring aggression in our policy, there should be aggression in our thinking, aggression in our strategy, aggression in the deployment of security forces, aggression in operations, aggression in bringing development, aggression in road construction.\n\n“We will have to be cautious that extremely defensive deployment may result in reduction of operational offensive.”\n\n“We have to ensure,” he added, “that the states take the ownership in the anti-Naxal operations where Central Armed Police Force will cooperate fully.”\n\nMaintaining that the solution to the Naxal problem did not lie in any “silver bullet”, Singh said everyone must analyse the current strategy, thinking, preparation and resources.\n\nAs many as 12,000 citizens had lost their lives in Maoist violence over the last two decades, he said. Of these, 2,700 were jawans of security forces and 9,300 were innocent common people.\n\nThere were no shortcuts to success, he said, underscoring the need for short term, medium term and long term policies at different levels.\n\n“There is need to find a solution for this problem and the strategy is available and encompassed in the word ‘SAMADHAN’. It means S- Smart Leadership, A- Aggressive Strategy, M-Motivation and Training, A- Actionable Intelligence, D-Dashboard Based KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and KRAs (Key Result Areas), H- Harnessing Technology, A- Action plan for each Theatr, N- No access to Financing.”\n\nReferring to the 9/11 terror attack, he said the US had taken on the challenge to ensure that there was no repeat. The 9/11 Commission stated that the incident was not failure of intelligence but the failure of imagination, he said.\n\n“Therefore, the SAMADHAN, which we have discussed today has inbuilt potential for imagination. We have to work on imaginative thinking on the whole situation so that that we can ‘Out Think’ and ‘Out Manoeuvre’ left wing extremists.”\n\nDeclaring that the fight was a coordinated battle that had to be fought to the finish and one, Singh asked, “Who could be more suitable and competent than you all? The presence of our forces should instill fear in the left wing extremists and a sense of confidence among the local people and tribals – ‘Let your action speak for itself’.”\n\nIndia was the largest democracy in the world that was sought to be weakened by the Maoists. “In order to free India from the influence of left wing extremists that encourage violence and killing, it is necessary that we all should think and work in this direction. I believe that efforts to suppress democracy through the influence of the gun will never succeed,” he said.\n\nThe chief ministers of Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand were in attendance. However, West Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee, Andhra Pradesh’s N. Chandrababu Naidu, Telangana’s K Chandrashekhar Rao and Madhya Pradesh’s Shivraj Singh Chouhan were missing.\n\nDistrict magistrates and superintendents of police of 35 worst-hit Naxal-affected districts along with heads of paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies are also attending the high-level security meet.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-08 12:24:13', 'i177.jpg', 1, -0.5, 'Maintaining that the solution to the Naxal problem did not lie in any “silver bullet”, Singh said everyone must analyse the current strategy, thinking, preparation and resources.(Representational Image) Maintaining that the solution to the Naxal problem did not lie in any “silver bullet”, Singh said everyone must analyse the current strategy, thinking, preparation and resources.“We will have to be cautious that extremely defensive deployment may result in reduction of operational offensive.”\n\n“We have to ensure,” he added, “that the states take the ownership in the anti-Naxal operations where Central Armed Police Force will cooperate fully.”\n\nMaintaining that the solution to the Naxal problem did not lie in any “silver bullet”, Singh said everyone must analyse the current strategy, thinking, preparation and resources.“Therefore, choking the financial resources of the left wing extremists is the most basic mantra in this fight,” he said at the meeting being held two weeks after an ambush in Sukma, Chhattisgarh, in which 25 paramilitary personnel were killed.The presence of our forces should instill fear in the left wing extremists and a sense of confidence among the local people and tribals – ‘Let your action speak for itself’.”\n\nIndia was the largest democracy in the world that was sought to be weakened by the Maoists.', 3, 23, 61, 9, 1),

(208, 'Chrysotile asbestos not hazardous, says India under Rotterdam Convention', 'India has once again opposed the listing of Chrysotile asbestos as a hazardous substance under the Rotterdam convention at the Conference of Parties (COP) that concluded in Geneva on Friday.\n\nApart from India, only six other countries-- Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Zimbabwe, Belarus, and Syria, have blocked the move out of 157 countries attending the conference.\n\nIndia is the largest exporter of Chrysotile asbestos in the world. The country’s asbestos demand is met through imports from Russia, Kazakhstan, Brazil and China.\n\nAsbestos refers to six naturally occurring fibrous silicate minerals that can be of the Chrysotile and Amphibole kind .The fact that it is cheap, robust and fire-resistant makes it useful in a variety of industries.\n\nChrysotile asbestos is the most widely used form of asbestos because it possesses greater tensile strength than amphibole variety. It is used in the manufacture of asbestos fabrics, cement sheets, pipes and related products. It is also used in brake linings, insulation and fireproof materials.\n\nThe World Health Organisation has found that all six forms of asbestos can cause cancer. Though it doesn’t refer to Chrysotile asbestos in particular the Indian government appears to echo this view. “Asbestos used as a part of construction material due to flame retardant quality poses a major risk to human health and environment,” a 2015 Indian Bureau of Mines report noted. “Asbestos has been linked to a number of serious medical conditions. These include the lungs and respiratory problems because asbestos is made of tiny fibres that when released into the air and prolonged breathing of air laden with asbestos dust, it can settle inside the lungs and irritate the tissues in the chest cavities.”\n\nExposure to asbestos mixed air has also been linked to Mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer of the lungs and digestive tract.\n\nWhat irks environmentalists and public health experts is that there is even opposition to recognizing it as hazardous. The Rotterdam convention only regulates trade in hazardous substances by ensuring that developing countries which are usually at the receiving end of the bargain can make informed decisions. Including of a substance in the hazardous material list does not mean that its trade is banned only that exporting countries need to obtain prior informed consent (PIC) from the importing country.\n\nIndia has opposed even this form of regulation. All the while India’s import of Chrysotile asbestos continues to grow significantly. It was 3,96,493 tonnes in 2014-15 compared to 2,85,870 in 2013-14. So does domestic demand, which is expected to touch 605,000 tonnes by 2016-17, according to the Bureau of Mines.\n\nIndia has a history of inconsistency in its stand regarding this form of asbestos. In the 2011 Convention of Parties (COP), in a surprise move the country supported the inclusion of Chrysotile asbestos in Annex III of the convention that requires Prior Informed Consent from the importing country. At the next COP, India reversed its stand based on a study by the India’s National Institute of Occupational Health, that was allegedly funded by the industry and widely discredited.\n\nIn 2016 India’s minister of state for the environment said that use of asbestos should be phased out. But this is the third consecutive time that India has blocked efforts to even have the substance listed as hazardous.\n\nCanada one of the largest exporters of Chrysotile asbestos was lauded for reversing its stand and supporting the listing of the substance in 2012. The Canadian government came under sustained pressure from environmentalists and public health groups in the country. That kind of public awareness does not exist in India.\n\n“Asbestos-related diseases cause great human suffering. Death from difficult to treat cancers and suffocation caused by asbestosis are terrible ways to die,” Arthur L. Frank MD, Professor of Public Health and Pulmonary Medicine, Drexel University, said in a release from the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization. “The callous disregard of some countries for educating workers condemns many to unnecessary and painful deaths.”', '2017-05-08 12:35:21', 'i208.jpg', 1, -0.85, 'In the 2011 Convention of Parties (COP), in a surprise move the country supported the inclusion of Chrysotile asbestos in Annex III of the convention that requires Prior Informed Consent from the importing country.India is the largest exporter of Chrysotile asbestos in the world.India has once again opposed the listing of Chrysotile asbestos as a hazardous substance under the Rotterdam convention at the Conference of Parties (COP) that concluded in Geneva on Friday.Canada one of the largest exporters of Chrysotile asbestos was lauded for reversing its stand and supporting the listing of the substance in 2012.These include the lungs and respiratory problems because asbestos is made of tiny fibres that when released into the air and prolonged breathing of air laden with asbestos dust, it can settle inside the lungs and irritate the tissues in the chest cavities.”\n\nExposure to asbestos mixed air has also been linked to Mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer of the lungs and digestive tract.', 3, 23, 61, 9, 1),

But, I can say they are in substantial numbers,” Abdul Sayeed, deputy commissioner of labour, Mahbubnagar, told HT.\n\nAccording to estimates by labour department insiders, up to 10 lakh people migrate from south Telangana districts in search of work every year. “The migration peaks during September and October. Most of them return to their villages if there are good rains during monsoon,” said a government official who declined to be named.\n\nMahbubnagar is reeling under drought this year, and insufficient water in Krishna river, which enters the district from neighbouring Karnataka, has broken the back of agriculture.

In the US, the number of women opting for STEM (science, technology, engineering and Math) in grad schools has halved over three decades and while women make up more than 51% of the workforce, they hold 26% of computing-related jobs, shows US Department of Labour data.\n\nDespite proving their mettle in academics and other avenues, including administrative and medical exams, women are not a favoured lot when it comes to specialised and higher studies, especially engineering.\n\nEngineering as a profession has been emasculated in the popular imagination. If it’s an engineer, it has to be a man. Though more and more women are making their presence felt—they represent 28% of the country’s 40 lakh engineering graduates—the IITs, a traditional male bastion, has been a tough nut to crack.\n\nOf 10,500 undergraduate students who took admission to the 23 IITs in the country last year, only 840 (8%) were women, compared to a little over 1,000 (close to 10%) in 2015, shows data from the JAB that conducts the Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced).\n\nNo woman has made it to the top 100 ranks and Riya Singh of Kota, who secured an All India Rank of 133, topper among 4,570 qualified women candidates, is the closest any woman has come.\n\nWhile JEE (Main) is relatively easy to clear, most aspirants feel the necessity for coaching for the Advanced exam. And it is here that the bias against women begins.\n\nThe panel constituted by the admission board notes this in its report. “Due to societal preferences and biases in India, by and large it is the sons who are sent for coaching rather than equally talented daughters.”\n\nPramod Maheshwari, director of Career Point, a coaching institute in Kota, says very few women opt for the engineering compared to men. His institutes merely have 20% women.\n\n“Holding traditional, paternalistic views, parents may believe that they are acting in the best interests of the girls, that they are protecting them from a hostile society, that they are preparing them for a suitable feminine role in life,” the report says.\n\n“There are overt and subtle biases in society against female students opting for engineering careers. These start with parents and close family who may hold traditional views on gender. Many parents still believe that engineering requires brute strength.\n\n“In schools, many teachers have orthodox views on career options for boys and girls. Hence, they advise and steer girls towards ‘feminine’ career choices rather than the ‘masculine’ engineering. Likewise, textbooks often cast girls/women in ‘feminine’ roles,” it notes.\n\nParents concur with the findings of the report. “IITs are not easy to crack. Apart from hard work, good coaching is a must,” says Sadhana Singh, a resident of Bhagalpur, Bihar who has decided not to send her daughter for coaching out of the state. “There aren’t many good coaching institutes here and we don’t feel comfortable sending our daughter to a new place where she will have to stay alone.”\n\nBesides safety issues, she observed that several students fall prey to depression while staying alone.\n\nThe issue of high suicides among trainees, especially in Kota, has been a cause of concern, for parents and the government.\n\nSingh, however, feels that more seats will definitely help more women get admission into IITs.\n\nShivali Goyal, who studied in IIT Delhi and is against the increase, however, says the move would benefit girls from under-privileged background where parents think twice before spending on coaching.\n\nWelcoming the decision, a former IIT director, who did not wish to be named, said it would make IITs more attractive to women.\n\n“Given the very low number of women in IIT BTechs, schoolgirls who aspire to do engineering tend to opt for NITs and other engineering colleges in preference to IITs. The very low admission rate of females in IIT BTech discourages young schoolgirls from trying for IIT,” he said. “The moment the percentage of women in a few IITs increase, all IITs will be seen as more attractive to women and their percentages will also improve,” he said.\n\nHowever, the professor warned against a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n“There are a few IITs that have higher female ratios and hence, may not have to implement the proposal fully. At the same time, the constraints in terms of hostel space, classroom and lab space will also differ for each IIT,” he said, stressing that implementation is the key.', '2017-05-08 12:42:27', 'i229.jpg', 1, 0.25, 'Alarmed by the decline in women’s number in IITs, the admission board of the institutes recently approved a hike in the number of seats for female students from 8% to 20% till 2019.“Due to societal preferences and biases in India, by and large it is the sons who are sent for coaching rather than equally talented daughters.”\n\nPramod Maheshwari, director of Career Point, a coaching institute in Kota, says very few women opt for the engineering compared to men.“The moment the percentage of women in a few IITs increase, all IITs will be seen as more attractive to women and their percentages will also improve,” he said.“Given the very low number of women in IIT BTechs, schoolgirls who aspire to do engineering tend to opt for NITs and other engineering colleges in preference to IITs.Of 10,500 undergraduate students who took admission to the 23 IITs in the country last year, only 840 (8%) were women, compared to a little over 1,000 (close to 10%) in 2015, shows data from the JAB that conducts the Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced).', 3, 23, 61, 9, 1),

Nalvi had to prove the majority on Sunday.\n\nThe Jhinda-led faction had dismissed Nalvi’s appointment, calling it unconstitutional. In the run-up to Sunday’s meeting, both Jhinda and Nalvi factions were claiming to have the majority support required to control the Sikh body in the state.\n\nBefore the meeting began, the 32 members, including Nalvi, who were present unanimously authorised Daduwal—also a member of the HSGMC—to take the final decision. The move assumes significance as Daduwal is a parallel head priest of the Takht Damdama Sahib, the post he got during the November 2015 Sarbat Khalsa (Sikh congregation) in Amritsar spearheaded by radicals in the wake of statewide protests in Punjab over the spate of sacrilege incidents of Guru Granth Sahib.\n\n“The meeting was summoned to elect the committee. The presence of 32-members in Sunday’s meeting was the largest ever. All the rights were given to me to decide the matter.

But the president and general secretary of the body will resign on July 14 irrespective of the Apex Court ruling to pave a way for electing the new body,” Nalvi said.\n\nWhat the tussle is about\n\nThe formation of the HSGMC in 2014 had triggered a major dispute between Punjab and Haryana with the then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal declaring to “fight-to-finish” against contentious legislation of then Congress government in Haryana to control Sikh shrines.\n\nThe emotive religious-political tussle had unfolded after Haryana in a hurried move formed a separate panel for management of Sikh shrines in the state. The move was seen as an attempt to dislodge the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC).\n\nWhile the Akali Dal had sounded the bugle for an agitation against the formation of the HSGMC, the SGPC had vowed to fight “a decisive battle” for the repeal of the controversial law enacted by the Haryana government.', '2017-05-08 12:54:55', 'i249.jpg', 1, -0.1, 'On the other hand, Jhinda said the meeting was summoned to clear the confusion created by his decision to appear before the Akal Takht, the supreme temporal seat of the Sikhs in Amritsar.While the Akali Dal had sounded the bugle for an agitation against the formation of the HSGMC, the SGPC had vowed to fight “a decisive battle” for the repeal of the controversial law enacted by the Haryana government.After being excommunicated by the Akal Takht in 2014, Jhinda on April 4 had appeared before the Akal Takht and tendered an apology for not complying with the summons issued against him by the Takht for demanding formation of the HSGMC.Sunday’s meeting in Kaithal that lasted for over five hours was held in the backdrop of the appointment of Didar Singh Nalvi’s as the president by a 28-member of HSGMC executive committee on April 9 after removing Jhinda from the post.This truce will remain in place till July 14, the day the Supreme Court is expected to deliver a verdict on the formation of HSGMC, which was challenged by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabhandhak Committee (SGPC).', 3, 23, 61, 9, 1),

All three have left their children with Naik and his wife.\n\n“I see my sons and daughters-in-law only once a year, when they are here for a month or two. They go back to Mumbai or Pune in search of work. When I was young, I used to migrate in search of work and now my children are doing the same,” said Naik, a tribal from Meka Hanuman Thanda of Narayanpet block in Telangana’s Mahbubnagar district. “The cycle is repeating now.”\n\nMany families like Naik’s, not only in his hamlet but also several villages across Mahbubnagar, Wanaparthy, Nagarkurnool and Gadwal districts, have been witnessing large-scale migration of agriculture labourers, mostly from tribal hamlets, to Mumbai, Pune, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.

But, I can say they are in substantial numbers,” Abdul Sayeed, deputy commissioner of labour, Mahbubnagar, told HT.\n\nAccording to estimates by labour department insiders, up to 10 lakh people migrate from south Telangana districts in search of work every year. “The migration peaks during September and October. Most of them return to their villages if there are good rains during monsoon,” said a government official who declined to be named.\n\nMahbubnagar is reeling under drought this year, and insufficient water in Krishna river, which enters the district from neighbouring Karnataka, has broken the back of agriculture.

That’s why we say, we are willing to mediate when India and Pakistan have problems. But the precondition is that both India and Pakistan accept it. We do this only out of goodwill. We do hope that there is no problem at all,” Luo said.\n\n“When the Mumbai terrorist attack on November 26, 2008, took place, I was Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, and I did a lot of mediation at that time,” he said.\n\nOn the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Luo said China has no intention to get involved in the sovereignty and territorial disputes between India and Pakistan.\n\n“China supports the solution of the disputes through bilateral negotiations between the two countries. The CPEC is for promoting economic cooperation and connectivity. It has no connections to or impact on sovereignty issues,” he said.\n\n“Even we can think about renaming the CPEC.

Simply put, we always put China first and we deal with problems based on their own merits. Take Kashmir issue for example, we supported the relevant UN resolutions before 1990s. Then we supported a settlement through bilateral negotiation in line with the Simla Agreement. This is an example of China taking care of India’s concern,” he said.\n\nOn India’s bid for the membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), he said, “We do not oppose any country’s membership, believing that a standard for admission should be agreed upon first.”\n\nOn trade ties between the two countries, Luo said he was happy to see that China has contributed its share to India’s development.\n\n“Today, China is the second largest economy in the world, with a GDP of 11 trillion US dollars.

In the US, the number of women opting for STEM (science, technology, engineering and Math) in grad schools has halved over three decades and while women make up more than 51% of the workforce, they hold 26% of computing-related jobs, shows US Department of Labour data.\n\nDespite proving their mettle in academics and other avenues, including administrative and medical exams, women are not a favoured lot when it comes to specialised and higher studies, especially engineering.\n\nEngineering as a profession has been emasculated in the popular imagination. If it’s an engineer, it has to be a man. Though more and more women are making their presence felt—they represent 28% of the country’s 40 lakh engineering graduates—the IITs, a traditional male bastion, has been a tough nut to crack.\n\nOf 10,500 undergraduate students who took admission to the 23 IITs in the country last year, only 840 (8%) were women, compared to a little over 1,000 (close to 10%) in 2015, shows data from the JAB that conducts the Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced).\n\nNo woman has made it to the top 100 ranks and Riya Singh of Kota, who secured an All India Rank of 133, topper among 4,570 qualified women candidates, is the closest any woman has come.\n\nWhile JEE (Main) is relatively easy to clear, most aspirants feel the necessity for coaching for the Advanced exam. And it is here that the bias against women begins.\n\nThe panel constituted by the admission board notes this in its report. “Due to societal preferences and biases in India, by and large it is the sons who are sent for coaching rather than equally talented daughters.”\n\nPramod Maheshwari, director of Career Point, a coaching institute in Kota, says very few women opt for the engineering compared to men. His institutes merely have 20% women.\n\n“Holding traditional, paternalistic views, parents may believe that they are acting in the best interests of the girls, that they are protecting them from a hostile society, that they are preparing them for a suitable feminine role in life,” the report says.\n\n“There are overt and subtle biases in society against female students opting for engineering careers. These start with parents and close family who may hold traditional views on gender. Many parents still believe that engineering requires brute strength.\n\n“In schools, many teachers have orthodox views on career options for boys and girls. Hence, they advise and steer girls towards ‘feminine’ career choices rather than the ‘masculine’ engineering. Likewise, textbooks often cast girls/women in ‘feminine’ roles,” it notes.\n\nParents concur with the findings of the report. “IITs are not easy to crack. Apart from hard work, good coaching is a must,” says Sadhana Singh, a resident of Bhagalpur, Bihar who has decided not to send her daughter for coaching out of the state. “There aren’t many good coaching institutes here and we don’t feel comfortable sending our daughter to a new place where she will have to stay alone.”\n\nBesides safety issues, she observed that several students fall prey to depression while staying alone.\n\nThe issue of high suicides among trainees, especially in Kota, has been a cause of concern, for parents and the government.\n\nSingh, however, feels that more seats will definitely help more women get admission into IITs.\n\nShivali Goyal, who studied in IIT Delhi and is against the increase, however, says the move would benefit girls from under-privileged background where parents think twice before spending on coaching.\n\nWelcoming the decision, a former IIT director, who did not wish to be named, said it would make IITs more attractive to women.\n\n“Given the very low number of women in IIT BTechs, schoolgirls who aspire to do engineering tend to opt for NITs and other engineering colleges in preference to IITs. The very low admission rate of females in IIT BTech discourages young schoolgirls from trying for IIT,” he said. “The moment the percentage of women in a few IITs increase, all IITs will be seen as more attractive to women and their percentages will also improve,” he said.\n\nHowever, the professor warned against a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n“There are a few IITs that have higher female ratios and hence, may not have to implement the proposal fully. At the same time, the constraints in terms of hostel space, classroom and lab space will also differ for each IIT,” he said, stressing that implementation is the key.', '2017-05-08 12:58:04', 'i259.jpg', 1, 0.25, 'Alarmed by the decline in women’s number in IITs, the admission board of the institutes recently approved a hike in the number of seats for female students from 8% to 20% till 2019.“Due to societal preferences and biases in India, by and large it is the sons who are sent for coaching rather than equally talented daughters.”\n\nPramod Maheshwari, director of Career Point, a coaching institute in Kota, says very few women opt for the engineering compared to men.“The moment the percentage of women in a few IITs increase, all IITs will be seen as more attractive to women and their percentages will also improve,” he said.“Given the very low number of women in IIT BTechs, schoolgirls who aspire to do engineering tend to opt for NITs and other engineering colleges in preference to IITs.Of 10,500 undergraduate students who took admission to the 23 IITs in the country last year, only 840 (8%) were women, compared to a little over 1,000 (close to 10%) in 2015, shows data from the JAB that conducts the Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced).', 3, 23, 61, 9, 1),

The incident occurred in Kareemnagar area of Gorakhpur where some people, protesting against a liquor shop, were removed by the police.BJP MLA Aggarwal reached the spot amid complaints by protesters that the Circle Officer Charu Nigam had forcibly removed them.They alleged that the police had hit a woman and dragged an 80-year-old man.The MLA questioned the IPS officer about her action and told that there had been orders by the state government that liquor shops will not function in densely populated residential areas.Amid the exchange of words, Nigam took out a handkerchief and wiped her tears.

However, I got emotional when my senior officer supported me."The protesters were removed from the road as they were obstructing the traffic, she said.When the MLA arrived, the road was free from protesters, which apparently angered him as had asked them to stay put and lift the blockade only after his persuasion, Nigam had claimed.On the other hand, Aggarwal accused the IPS officer of exercising high-handedness with the protesters, who were demanding that a liquor outlet in their locality be shut."We are against the operation of liquor shops. People were peacefully protesting against the liquor shops, but the woman police officer forcibly removed the protesters and while doing so, she hit a woman and dragged an 80-year-old man. This simply cannot be tolerated," he said.Aggarwal rubbished allegations that he misbehaved with her. He alleged that there was a tacit understanding between the police and the liquor mafia as a liquor shop closed 15 days ago had suddenly started doing business again.When asked to comment on the footage telecast by local news channels, Aggarwal said, "Is my body language showing that I am misbehaving with her?

This forecast is “underpinned by higher private and public consumption and increased infrastructure spending,” the report said.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund last month projected India’s growth at 7.2 per cent in the fiscal 2017-18 and at 7.7 per cent for the next financial year. While, the Manila-headquartered Asian Development Bank sees growth jumping to 7.4 per cent in 2017-18 and 7.6 per cent in the next.\n\nEven at this rate, India will continue to clock a better growth than China, which is expected to grow at around 6.5 per cent in 2017. “Meanwhile, inflation is projected to reach 5.3-5.5 per cent in 2017 and 2018, which is somewhat above the official target of 4.5-5 per cent,” the ESCAP said.\n\nA heightened financial sector risk emanates from concentration of huge pile of soar assets sitting on the books of public sector banks, it added. These banks’ gross non-performing assets as percentage of gross advances hit almost 12 per cent in 2016. “This points to the need for bank recapitalisation.”\n\nOn the demonetisation drive taken by government during November-December last calender, the UN report said the impact would be transient on the economy. However, a slower-than-expected recovery would particularly diminish the outlook for cash-intensive sectors and supply chains for agricultural products.\n\nIn the medium-term, India will also benefit from recent reforms measures aimed at declogging supply side bottlenecks, it added. Implementation of good and services tax (GST), amendment of a bankruptcy law and opening up of pharmaceuticals, defence and civil aviation sectors will help India in its economic growth, the report said.\n\nOn the trends in the Asia-Pacific region, the UN ESCAP has found growth in the region moderating in recent years compared to its historical trend and a rebound in 2010. “The region’s export-oriented economic growth strategy is under pressure amid prolonged weakness in external demand and global trade,” the report said.\n\n“China is both a transmitter and a source of the current economic slowdown, given its role as a hub in global value chains and it rebalanced towards consumption and services,” it said.

(Representational photo)\n\nThis is perhaps the best time to buy a house from the point of view of affordability in the last decade or so. According to a CLSA report, income growth in the last three years has overtaken housing prices and affordability in the current fiscal is the best since 2005.\n\nMortgage rates have come down by 150 basis points in the last two years bringing them down to 12-year lows, and this is gradually improving affordability. Every 100 basis points mortgage-rate cut is equal to 5-6 per cent price cut, CLSA has noted.\n\nData from research firm PropEquity shows the weighted average price of unsold apartments — across 8 cities — fell by 1.67 per cent sequentially over the December quarter to Rs 6,185 per sq ft.\n\nProperty prices in seven of the country’s top eight cities fell in the three months to March with builders eager to liquidate inventory in a market badly hit by demonetisation.\n\nThe price of a mass-premium quality house located in a metro city suburb having a ticket price of Rs 60 lakh has remained flat on a year-on-year basis. However, the post-tax household income has gone up by 7.5 per cent y-o-y, in FY18 to Rs 13 lakh per annum, while the loan-to-value (LTV) is at 70 per cent, and the mortgage rate at 8.5 per cent — increasing the affordability much more than in the past.\n\nLTV is a financial term used by lenders to express the ratio of a loan to the value of an asset purchased. The affordability has improved much more for the lower ticket priced homes. For instance, for a Rs 20-lakh house, credit linked subsidy scheme (CLSS) is around 10-12 per cent of cost, which has led to improvement in affordability levels to best ever.\n\nFurther, the government is incentivising affordable unit construction through changes like affordable house having a carpet area of 60 sq. metre, with affordable project seeing tax rates at effective 20 per cent (minimum alternate tax rate) versus 34 per cent. Also giving infrastructure status for such projects has further improved the sector’s ability to get cheaper loans.

This will be different from the operator-assisted tests," he added.\n\nThe operator-assisted drive test captures real-time data to monitor the level of call drops and voice quality, similar to Trai''s independent drive tests.\n\nHowever, unlike independent drive tests that are conducted by the regulator itself, the ''operator-assisted'' tests are conducted in co-ordination with telecom service providers.\n\nThe operator-assisted tests, a new concept, involves the telecom firms'' equipment and costs, with the regulator monitoring and supervising the entire process.\n\nThat said, all drive tests -- be it independent or operator-assisted tests -- assess the performance of networks on various quality benchmarks, including call set-up success rate, call drop, blocked calls and Radio Frequency (RF) coverage.\n\nThe last round of independent drive tests were conducted by Trai in Amritsar, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bhopal, Chandigarh, Mumbai, Lucknow, Kanpur, Ahmedabad, Ranchi, Darjeeling, Sikkim and Trivandrum in 2016.\n\nDuring the last few months that Trai did not undertake independent tests, the operator-assisted tests were conducted in cities including Mathura (UP-West circle), Jaisalmer, (Rajasthan), Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh) and Mangalore (Karnataka) and others.\n\nBoth the regulator and the Department of Telecom (DoT) have been keeping a vigil on service quality issues such as call drops and call failures through initiatives like drive tests and automated call system.\n\nLast year, when instances of call drops spiked, the government and the regulator made a co-ordinated effort to tackle the issue through deliberations with the industry.\n\nThe Telecom Department has set up an IVRS or automated call system, which makes random calls to subscribers to check status of call drops.\n\nAs part of efforts to keep the call quality in check, the Trai plans to roll-out, by the month-end, an app that will enable subscribers to rate the service quality of a phone call, once the call is complete. The data will, thereafter, be analysed by the regulator.

A significant ''risk off'' surge has been avoided," they wrote in a note to clients on Monday, reiterating conviction in their MEGA trade - "Making Europe Great Again".\n\nThe details of Monday''s reaction on global financial markets suggest many came to this conclusion weeks ago and are moving back to other concerns - about China, global commodities or the shape of U.S. and European monetary policy for the next year.\n\nThe euro hit a roughly six-month high when Macron beat Le Pen and another anti-euro candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, in the first round last month. By the time European traders got to their desks on Monday any new boost had largely dissipated.\n\nEuropean stock markets also looked firmly in profit-taking mood, down around half a percent after a year which has seen them gain more than a fifth in value.\n\n"This marks an important shift in the narrative around European politics: not all popular discontent in Europe can be channelled as anti-EU or purely nationalistic," said Steven Andrew, macro fund manager at M&G Investments.\n\n"Euro Area equities, currently attractively priced, could deliver substantial investment returns in the period ahead."\n\nMERKEL''S RIVAL DISAPPOINTED\n\nPresident of the European Parliament until January, Schulz''s decision in January to return to domestic politics forced global investors to face the risk of the removal this year of Merkel - a key political constant through years of euro zone turbulence.\n\nA decisive victory in Germany''s northern state of Schleswig-Holstein on Sunday, however, boosted Merkel''s prospects of winning the national election in September and left Schulz admitting bluntly he was "disappointed".\n\nIt follows another win for Merkel in the western state of Saarland. In both she has increased her share of the vote while that for the SPD has fallen.\n\nA third regional vote, in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) next Sunday, offers Merkel''s conservatives a chance to defeat the incumbent SPD again and build momentum in her bid to win a fourth term in office.\n\n"These state elections will have a signal effect on what will happen," said Martin Lueck, Chief Investment Strategist for Germany with giant global asset manager Blackrock.\n\n5-STAR\n\nItaly has been a perennial pressure-point for Europe through almost a decade of crisis - yet one that has never quite come to a head.\n\nRecent opinion polls give a clear and growing lead to the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which wants to hold a referendum on Italy''s continued membership of the euro zone if it wins elections due early next year.\n\n"I am nervous about Italy already because of the way 5-Star are polling," said Roger Hallam, Chief Investment Officer for currencies with JP Morgan Asset Management in London.\n\n"It is one of the things which stopped us from forecasting the euro materially higher this year.

After with (former French president Francois) Hollande and the likes they managed to freeze everything," Delpla said.\n\n"Now we have a combination of a liberal in France who is willing to push for such an agenda and then growth, which will help a lot."\n\nWhile Macron''s position on euro bonds is not clear-cut, a source close to the president-elect told Reuters he favoured the creation of a bloc-wide euro zone budget, which would provide for joint borrowing. Macron outlined this position in June 2015 with Sigmar Gabriel, now Germany''s foreign minister, in a joint column for Britain''s The Guardian newspaper.\n\nDelpla''s concept for these "euro bonds" is one of many.\n\nEU institutions are examining another, which envisages a trans-national synthetic "safe" bond backed by debt from euro zone states.\n\nGERMAN OPPOSITION\n\nMacron''s victory was applauded in Germany and some believe he may be able to soften German opposition to euro bonds, which could anyway be about to change.\n\nMartin Schulz - the Social Democrat contender in Germany''s Federal elections in September - repeatedly advocated euro bonds during the debt crisis but recently backed off the plan, which does not play well with frugal German voters.\n\nSchulz has lost two regional elections to Chancellor Angela Merkel''s conservatives this year, and faces another test in populous North-Rhine-Westphalia on Sunday.\n\nBut even in defeat, Schulz''s socialists could barter for control of the finance ministry in coalition talks. A euro zone official told Reuters that in this case, German opposition to euro bonds may become less categorical, or there could be highly conditional support.\n\nGermans, who have paid the lion''s share of bailouts to Greece, Portugal and Ireland, have long opposed joint borrowing as they fear it would cost them more and remove the incentive for struggling states to reform their economies.\n\nBut Berlin does want to tackle the problem of regional banks holding too much of their own government''s debt, the so-called "doom loop" which can threaten both in a crisis.\n\nThis has brought to the fore the idea of a "safe" bond, which does not require joint guarantees like Delpla''s euro bond but creates a proxy euro wide synthetic asset that could diversify bank holdings of sovereign debt.\n\nFrederik Ducrozet, a senior economist at Pictet, said greater trust between France and Germany could be more important than details of the bonds.\n\n"There is a window of opportunity after the German election, especially with Macron as the next French president," he said.\n\n"It would be perhaps negotiating tactics that you discuss all options including euro bonds with the idea that you can get a deal in between... perhaps something like safe bonds."\n\nALREADY EXIST?\n\nIn some senses euro-wide bonds already exist.\n\nAn emergency bailout vehicle was set up in 2010 to raise funding for countries in distress on the back of a guarantee from each euro zone member. A permanent bailout fund followed in 2012 into which each member paid in start-up capital.\n\nKalin Anev Janse, the Secretary General of these bailout facilities, said there were wide differences of opinion on what constitutes a euro bond and more discussions on the subject might follow later this year.\n\n"A good time for Europe to look at issues regarding the future of the euro area will be in the autumn, at the end of the year, once the French and German elections are completed. Then we would need to sit down together and see where we want to take Europe over the next 5-10 years," said Janse.\n\nEven if France and Germany reach agreement though, euro bonds would still likely need approval from the other 17 euro zone states. That could still prove difficult.\n\n"Countries in very different situations should focus more economic policies to lift growth and less on financial engineering," Lithuania''s Finance Minister Vilius Sapoka told Reuters, adding the time was not yet right for jointly-underwritten bonds.\n\n(Additional reporting by Marc Jones and Dhara Ranasinghe in LONDON, Jamie McGeever in LUXEMBOURG, Jan Strupczewski in BRUSSELS, Michel Rose in PARIS and Paul Carrel in BERLIN; Editing by John Stonestreet)', '2017-05-08 13:43:04', 'i321.jpg', 3, 0.1, 'By John Geddie\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Emmanuel Macron''s victory in France''s presidential election is the biggest step yet in pursuit of pushing the idea of joint euro zone bonds past robust German opposition, the author of one of the first proposals for such a scheme told Reuters.While Macron''s position on euro bonds is not clear-cut, a source close to the president-elect told Reuters he favoured the creation of a bloc-wide euro zone budget, which would provide for joint borrowing.This has brought to the fore the idea of a "safe" bond, which does not require joint guarantees like Delpla''s euro bond but creates a proxy euro wide synthetic asset that could diversify bank holdings of sovereign debt."A good time for Europe to look at issues regarding the future of the euro area will be in the autumn, at the end of the year, once the French and German elections are completed.In a year when a populist upsurge in elections in the euro zone was to be its biggest test since the 2011/2012 debt crisis, Sunday''s clear win for the pro-European Macron over far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen has sowed expectations for greater financial and economic integration in the bloc.', 3, 23, 62, 8, 1),

Spot gold rose 0.4 percent to $1,232.61 per ounce by 1211 GMT, after touching 1,224.86 earlier in the session, its lowest level since March 17. The precious metal, seen as a safe haven, fell 3.2 percent last week, its biggest percentage fall in 25 weeks as polls indicated a landslide for Macron. U.S. gold futures rose 0.5 percent to $1,233 an ounce. "The result of (the French) election was pretty well forecast ... Last week we had some sizeable (long) liquidation in gold and physical demand remains pretty good right now ... I''m not surprised to see gold supported around current levels," ICBC Standard Bank analyst Tom Kendall said. The removal of the political risk associated with Macron''s rival Marine Le Pen - who had vowed to take France out of the euro - leaves investors refocusing on the pace of monetary policy normalisation in Europe and the United States. The European Central Bank is expected to have more room to tighten policy as the euro zone''s economic recovery gathers pace. In the United States, data out Friday showed job growth rebounded sharply in April and the unemployment rate dropped to near a 10-year low, which is seen as reinforcing the case for a U.S. interest rate hike next month.

Fund managers have also turned increasingly negative on the outlook for the price of refined fuels given the high level of stockpiles in the United States.\n\nHedge funds cut their net long position in NYMEX gasoline by 24 million barrels in the week to May 2 and are now running a small net short position of 3 million barrels for the first time since August 2016 (http://tmsnrt.rs/2qSg88G).\n\nHedge funds also cut their net long position in NYMEX heating oil by 26 million barrels and are now net short by almost 1 million barrels, the first short position since November 2016 (http://tmsnrt.rs/2qStiCs).\n\nPRICE MOVES\n\nThe liquidation of hedge fund positions followed by a sharp drop in oil prices is consistent with empirical and theoretical work on price dynamics.\n\nSignificant liquidation often starts before a sharp drop in oil prices ("Why stock markets crash: critical events in complex financial systems", Sornette, 2003).\n\nThe initial liquidation is orderly but accelerates as more and more position owners rush for the exit at the same time ("Predatory trading and crowded exits", Clunie, 2010).\n\nPierre Andurand, one of the most prominent bullish hedge fund managers in oil, reportedly liquidated his last remaining long positions during the final week of April, before the price rout on May 4 ("Oil bull Andurand closes bet on rally", Reuters, May 5).\n\nGiven the further sharp decline in oil prices it is very likely hedge fund managers have cut their net long position even more since May 2.\n\nThe elimination of so many long positions has left the oil derivatives market looking more balanced than at any time since November, which could ease some of the downward pressure on prices.\n\nAnd short positioning has also increased to a relatively high level of 263 million barrels across Brent and WTI which leaves the market vulnerable to a short-covering rally.\n\nOverall, hedge fund positioning in oil now appears neutral. What happens next, whether the funds turn bullish again or become more bearish, depends largely on what happens to oil inventories over the summer.

The proper Fed policy rate for that situation, he concluded, was less than one percent - about where the rate is now following the Fed''s most recent rate rise in March.\n\nThe situation is also characterized by a decline in the "natural" rate of interest - an abstract concept that Fed officials estimate as a rate that would neither encourage or discourage economic activity. In remarks at an Atlanta Federal Reserve bank conference, Bullard said he found in a recent study that much of that decline could be attributed to strong demand for safe assets like U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nHe did not offer a reason for why demand for those assets has been so strong since the turn of the century, but the idea is similar to that of former Fed chair Ben Bernanke and others who have looked at the implications of a "global savings glut."\n\nFor the Fed, Bullard said, the fact that safe asset demand remains strong, along with the fact that growth in the labor force and labor productivity remain weak, means there is no need to rush into rate hikes.\n\n"The natural rate of interest, and hence the appropriate policy rate, is low and unlikely to change very much," said Bullard. With unemployment low and inflation near target, he said, the Fed has arguably achieved its goals with a policy rate set at between 0.75 and 1.0 percent.\n\n"The policy rate is approximately at an appropriate setting today," he said.

The euro, which initially surged to a six-month high on Monday, also gave up its gains against the dollar and Western Europe''s main equities indices, including Paris, fell. Macron''s victory over the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen underpins views that France remains committed to European Union and euro zone membership. The reaction of markets shows that the outcome had been mostly priced in, said Zoltan Varga, analyst of Equilor brokerage in Budapest. "This is the classic buy on the rumour, sell on the news," he said. Macron''s victory may mean some political friction for some Central European states in the medium-term, he added. Macron said after his first-round victory that he would push for EU sanctions against Poland to defend the bloc''s democratic values. He has also criticized Hungary. The overall impact is positive as it brings more stability into European politics "so this would be highly beneficial for CEE markets which largely depend on the EU political unity," Raiffeisen analyst Gintaras Shlizhyus said in a note. Macron will still face a tough national assembly elections campaign, Erste analysts said in a note. Central European currencies traded 0.1 to 0.2 percent firmer against the euro at 1134GMT. Initially, the Czech crown and the zloty strengthened by about 0.4 percent, with the crown touching a four-week high and the zloty testing 20-month highs. Regional stock indices mostly eased, by less than 0.7 percent, or were flat. Warsaw''s bluechip index shed 0.6 percent, partly dragged down by a 4.5 percent fall of the shares of KGHM . The company, one of the world''s biggest copper producers, reported a 147 percent surge in its first-quarter net profits but its share price was hit by copper prices resuming their downward trend. Copper prices fell to $5,493 per tonne on Monday after Friday''s rebound from five-month lows. KGHM Chief Executive Radoslaw Domagalski-Labedzki said he saw no fundamental reasons for the price to stay below $5500. Bucharest''s main index shed 0.1 percent, driven down by a 3.6 percent fall in the shares of BRD, which retreated from a six-year high hit on Friday after the bank reported a jump in first-quarter earnings. Demand for 5-year bonds auctioned by the Romanian government surged, and the maximum yield at which the bonds were sold was a lower-than-expected 2.78 percent. Polish bonds firmed a shade. Their yields dropped 2-3 basis points and 5-year papers traded at a yield of 2.88 percent.

(329, 'COLUMN-Rains to the rescue after French wheat farmers draw short straw -Braun', '(Repeats for wider distribution. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a market analyst for Reuters.)\n\nBy Karen Braun\n\nCHICAGO, May 8 (Reuters) - Grain yields worldwide have consistently broken records over the last few years, but France has been unable to partake in that trend as much as it might like and the chance could be missed again this year.\n\nLast year, France harvested one of its worst-ever wheat crops as intense spring rainfall led to yield losses close to 30 percent. The European country notched a record crop in 2015, but the two previous harvests were very lackluster, including one that took a big hit on quality due to late-season rains.\n\nFrance''s wheat crop is typically the world''s fifth-largest, and the country is a key supplier of the grain within the region, including to other European Union members as well as North Africa. The vast majority of French wheat is the soft variety and is planted in the autumn.\n\nThe 2017-18 crop was sown in the autumn of 2016 under some of the driest conditions in many years, and precipitation levels ever since have been low. Wheat is a fairly resilient grain that can be refreshed coming out of a dry winter with good spring rains, but April was bone dry.\n\nFrench soft wheat ratings plunged 16 percent during April, a decline not commonly seen this early in the year. Farm office FranceAgriMer rated 74 percent of the soft wheat in good or excellent condition as of May 1 after opening April around 90 percent (http://reut.rs/2phHDI9).\n\nFor comparison, good-to-excellent ratings for French soft wheat were 92 percent and 91 percent at the start of April 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2016 score fell to 87 percent by the beginning of May while 2015 maintained at 91 percent.\n\nThe country did pick up some rain in the final week of April, but the modest amounts did nothing to prevent crop ratings from falling by 4 percent on the week.\n\nRAINS ARRIVE\n\nMay has brought along with it a vastly different weather pattern that will give much-needed relief to the fading crops. The next two weeks will be characterized by frequent rainy days all across the country, and the expected amounts are enough to make a difference.\n\nThe wheat-heavy Centre region could receive a total of 2.4 inches (61 mm) from May 6 through May 20, which is not that much less than what the area received in March and April combined. Most regions in the country can expect somewhere in the vicinity of 2 inches (51 mm) during this important time frame, as soft wheat was just 3 percent headed as of May 1.\n\nFarmers will be delighted by the prospect of some rains, but last year may have made them wary of receiving too much of a good thing. Rains would not shut off during the entire spring of 2016. When they finally did, they never came back.\n\nThis took a toll on many of the country''s summer crops including corn. French corn growers are looking to put the back-to-back disaster harvests of 2015 and 2016 behind them, and they could use a boost from the rains right now as 84 percent of the crop is now in the ground.\n\nThe fact that wheat crop ratings have already fallen so far leaves some uncertainty as to how much can be made up, especially after starting so dry. If the rainy forecast materializes but does not become a staple for the rest of the growing season, the crop should turn out OK, though possibly not atop record books.\n\nFRANCE LOSS, USA WIN?\n\nFrance''s misfortunes one year ago have potentially turned into extra business for U.S. wheat merchants.\n\nThe United States had the opposite problem of France in 2016 as it produced a much larger wheat crop than originally anticipated, driving stocks to 30-year highs and boosting the need for increased export business to stimulate prices.\n\nFranceAgriMer expects that France will have exported about 10.7 million tonnes of soft wheat by the conclusion of the 2016-17 crop year this summer. This is about half the value from the previous year, and exports to non-EU countries have taken the biggest cuts. Those exports are estimated at about 5 million tonnes this year compared with 12.6 million last year.\n\nSome of France''s biggest customers in North Africa appear to have been scooping up much more of the U.S. product than usual this year, in fact about nine times the volume of last year. Through March, Algeria had made its largest U.S. wheat haul in nine years, and Morocco the largest in 23 years, combined with its own wheat crop disasters last year.\n\nNorth Africa has provided the United States with 43.4 million more bushels of business so far in 2016-17 than in 2015-16. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has placed 2016-17 U.S. exports at 1.025 billion bushels, meaning that without the extra shipments this year, exports would be closer to 982 million bushels.\n\n(Editing by Matthew Lewis)', '2017-05-08 13:46:38', 'i330.jpg', 3, 0.55, 'French corn growers are looking to put the back-to-back disaster harvests of 2015 and 2016 behind them, and they could use a boost from the rains right now as 84 percent of the crop is now in the ground.FranceAgriMer expects that France will have exported about 10.7 million tonnes of soft wheat by the conclusion of the 2016-17 crop year this summer.Some of France''s biggest customers in North Africa appear to have been scooping up much more of the U.S. product than usual this year, in fact about nine times the volume of last year.France''s wheat crop is typically the world''s fifth-largest, and the country is a key supplier of the grain within the region, including to other European Union members as well as North Africa.The country did pick up some rain in the final week of April, but the modest amounts did nothing to prevent crop ratings from falling by 4 percent on the week.', 3, 23, 62, 8, 1),

(331, 'A magic spell that makes money vanish', 'Those who study narcotics addiction have invented the term `gateway drug''. It seems that many drug-users start with mild narcotics like marijuana and gradually move up to harder stuff like heroin and crack. It so happens that there''s an almost exact equivalent to this in equity investing as well, except that the first stage is actually beneficial.The default Indian saver saves all of his or her money in deposits with banks or post offices or the government. Some of these people--perhaps about two crore of them -have started investing in equity funds. The gateway investment to equity funds is often a tax-saving fund--one of the so-called ELSS funds.As ELSS investments come with a lockin, they are forced to stay put for three years, which is a reasonably long period to see good gains. For most of these investors, the idea that equity funds can get you good returns becomes an obvious. So far, so good.A certain proportion goes beyond this gateway stage--generally with the help of equity investment''s equivalent of a drug dealer. This person often goes by the name of a wealth manager or a relationship manager or something like that and is generally employed by a bank or a stockbroker. The logic given is simple: why are you wasting your time?Since you know that equity returns are better than a bank deposit, let me introduce you to the form of equity that can get you the highest possible returns from equity, which is effendo Even though `effendo'' sounds like a magical spell from Harry Potter (like Confundo or Diffindo), it is not. It is actually the popular way to pronounce F&O, otherwise known as futures and options, or derivatives. Effendo is closely related to a Harry Potter spell called Evanesco which makes things vanish.Effendo can make money vanish as if by magic, as it regularly does for investors lured into short-term trading using these types of investment avenues. Actually, effendo does not make money vanish, as much as it transfers it magi cally into the bank accounts of your broker.Now I know the whole spiel about how derivatives provide depth and breadth to the stock markets , but for a vast majority of small investors, they are none of that. Instead, as Warren Buffet pointed out, they are nothing but financial weapons of mass destruction.But aren''t derivatives meant to be a good thing?The answer to that question lies in one of the distortions that have crept into the Indian stock markets ever since derivatives trading began. Derivatives like futures and options can be used to protect traders against risk, acting like an insurance policy. However, they can also be used to enhance risk and returns, effectively as an instrument that offers a chance of higher gains, but also a high risk of huge losses, including completely wiping out the investor''s capital.The real problem is not that using futures and options in this manner is possible, but that almost every part of the equities trading industry is dedicated to getting customers into this kind of trading. Practically every broker-and that definitely includes banks'' `wealth management'' units--does this and certainly all the stock exchanges have spared no effort in getting as many people to trade as speculatively as possible. This kind of institutional behaviour is certainly disappointing, but not surprising. So, much of the behaviour of India''s big financial players is subethical that one suffers from a bit of outrage fatigue.However, the important point is that savers should save themselves from being herded into such kind of trading.It''s certainly not a natural extension of safe and sensible investing of the kind that one does in a tax-saving or other equity fund.

(332, 'Provident Fund: At 7.9%, PPF still best bet', 'Some investors may be feeling disappointed by the cut in the Public Provident Fund (PPF) rate. The government-managed scheme will now offer 7.9% interest, which is a 40-year low for the scheme. Besides, there are indications that the rates of small savings schemes could see more cuts in the coming months as bond yields decline further.Should you withdraw your investment from the PPF and invest the money somewhere else to earn better returns? No, say experts, pointing out that the tax-free status of the PPF makes it the best debt option for investors. Other options may offer a higher interest rate, but the post-tax returns will not match those from the PPF.Besides, the PPF rate is well above the inflation level. Given that consumer inflation is down to 3.65%, the real rate of return of the PPF is a healthy 4.25%. "This is quite impressive for an option that offers assured returns," says Amol Joshi, Founder, PlanRupee Investment Service. "Investors should continue to take advantage of this long-term tax-free product," he adds.Analysts believe that the PPF should be compared with the benchmark 10-year bond yield."The 10-year bond yield is a better benchmark for PPF than consumer inflation," says Manoj Nagpal , CEO, Outlook Asia Capital. Even then, the scheme looks attractive. Currently, the 10year bond yield is around 6.8%. At 7.9%, the PPF is offering a premium of 110 basis points."Historically, the average premium has been around 75 bps. So, the PPF investor is today earning a higher real return," says Nagpal.We examine the pros and cons of different options before investors.Interest rate offered: 6.5-7.5%Tax treatment: Interest is fully taxableLike the PPF, bank fixed deposits offer assured returns. But the interest is fully taxable so the post-tax return for someone in the 30% tax bracket is a meagre 4.55-5.25%. So this option is out of the question. The tax-free bonds issued by PSUs is also not a viable alternative because the yields have come off from their highs and settled at around 6.25%.Our assessment: Not advisable, because both options will give lower post-tax returns than PPF.Interest rate offered Tax treatment: 8.4% (For 2016-17)Tax treatment: Tax free corpusIf you have a daughter, you can consider opening a Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana account for her and shift your PPF corpus there to earn better returns. The Sukanya interest rate will stay ahead of PPF by 50-60 basis points. But shifting to the scheme could take a few years because there is a `1.5 lakh annual investment limit in the Sukanya scheme. Also, the lock-in period is linked to the age of the girl and you will not be able to access the money before she turns 18.Our assessment: Works for people with daughters aged below 10Interest rate offered: 8.65% (For 2016-17)Tax treatment: Tax free corpusThis option is open to salaried individuals covered by the EPF. They can withdraw from the PPF and increase the monthly contribution to the Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF). In months, they can shift the entire amount from PPF to VPF where it would earn a higher return. Experts believe though PPF rates may be cut, the government may not tinker too much with the EPF rate. The EPF is no longer a 100% debt option. The EPFO has allowed up to 10% of incremental in -flows to be invested in stocks. Returns could be hit if markets tumble. Experts also warn that EPF rates will eventually drop.Our assessment: Worth a try, but even EPF rate will dip when overall interest rates fall.Returns: 8.83% (past one year)Tax treatment: Gains taxed at 20% (after indexation benefit)after three yearsInvestors looking for higher returns can opt for debt funds. Short-term debt funds can generate 8-8.5% returns. There is no limit to the amount one can invest unlike other traditional options. Though gains are taxable, the investor is eligible for indexation benefit if the funds are held for 3 years. Indexation adjusts the buying price by factoring in inflation during the holding period, lowering tax significantly.Our assessment: The post-tax returns will not be able to match the assured returns offered by PPF.Returns: 7.73% past three yearsTax treatment: Gains are tax free after one yearThe tax impact can be nullified if you choose arbitrage funds. These funds invest in equities and derivatives to earn risk-free returns. Their equity status means the gains are tax free after one year of holding. However, the returns from these funds have come down in recent years. Also, the tax treatment could change in the coming years as in case of debt funds.Our assessment: Even though returns are tax free after one year, they will not be able to match the assured returns offered by PPF.Returns: 11.34% past three yearsTax treatment: Gains taxed at 20% (after indexation) if held for three yearsInvestors willing to take a small risk will find the monthly income plans (MIPs) of mutual funds rewarding. These funds invest only a small portion (15-20%) of their corpus in equities while the rest is in debt. The category has given returns of around 11% in the past three years. "MIPs suit first-time investors in equities," says Vidya Bala, Head of Mutual Fund Research, FundsIndia. The equity portion help deliver a higher return, but it comes at the cost of volatility.

(333, 'How to survive a financial crisis and avoid being cheated', 'It took Naveen Mandhana almost two decades to save Rs 35 lakh. And just one wrong step to lose it all. When his fixed deposits matured in 2007 and his savings bank account swelled, Mandhana got a call from his bank. A relationship manager advised him to put Rs 25 lakh in a real estate fund and Rs 10 lakh in an art fund. “Real estate and art were the flavours of the season in 2007,” says Mandhana.That was the start of a 10-year nightmare. The real estate fund gave good returns of 12-13% in the first couple of years. Then as the real estate sector slowed down, the returns stopped too. The fund was supposed to mature in 2013, but Mandhana is yet to get back the principal. As for the art fund, he got back only Rs 9.5 lakh on maturity four years ago.For Mandhana, it has been a costly but important lesson. He now invests in regular mutual funds and does not shirk from taking professional advice. A financial planner would have advised him to stay away from exotic instruments like real estate funds and art funds. “Small investors should focus on basic needs like adequate cover for life and health and use mutual funds, equities and bonds to achieve goals,” says Priyesh Sampat, Head, Strategic Solutions, Simplifying Legacies Empowering Successors, a financial advisory firm.This week’s cover story looks at people who suffered serious financial setbacks, either due to frauds and mis-selling or poor investment choices. Some of them managed to bounce back due to their grit and determination. Others learnt important lessons and moved on. Over the next few pages, these survivors of financial mishaps relate their stories. We also reached out to experts to know what should have been the right course of action in these situations.Naveen Mandhana, 60, Mumbai, Financial CoachWas talked into investing his life’s savings of Rs 35 lakh into risky art funds and realty funds by his bank’s relationship manager 10 years ago.Mandhana got back Rs 9.5 lakh from the art fund after six years but is yet to recover Rs 25 lakh from the realty fund. He now invests only in regular mutual funds and does not shirk from taking professional advice.Some of the tales of survival are indeed inspiring. Meet Deepti Goel, who lost her husband to cancer seven years ago. Goel was targeted by unscrupulous agents who saddled her with multiple Ulips and mutual funds she didn’t need. To make matters worse, the agents churned the portfolio to earn higher commissions. Things became so bad that Goel used to suffer panic attacks every month when SIPs were due. “All I was doing was ensuring that all the SIPs got paid and then I could go back to work and looking after the family,” she says.Deepti Goel, 46, Noida, BusinesswomanUnscrupulous distributors and insurance agents sold her multiple Ulips and 20 mutual fund schemes after her husband’s death. They also churned her portfolio often to earn commission.With the help of a financial planner, Goel got rid of costly insurance plans and pruned her portfolio to a mix of 5-6 funds. She also realised the folly of mixing investment and insurance.Luckily for her, she met an upright financial planner who not only helped her junk costly insurance policies but also taught her the basics of financial planning. “The knowledge empowered me and allowed me to identify the mistakes I had made,” she says. Goel is now on her way to become a financial planner and helps other people get a grip on their finances.Not everyone is as lucky. Two years ago, Mumbai residents Girish and Shilpa Peswani were contacted by a broker who showed them a property in a Mumbai suburb. He claimed that the property was available at a good discount because it was being auctioned to repay loans taken by the owner. The Peswanis fell for the ploy and paid a token amount of Rs 1.5 lakh. But when they asked to see the documents, the broker kept fobbing them off with some vague excuses. When he asked for an additional Rs 1 lakh, the Peswanis realised that something was amiss. They found that the broker had sold the same flat to several other buyers in the past and disappeared with the token money. When they tried to cancel the deal, the broker gave them a cheque that bounced. Rattled by the loss, the Peswanis have suspended their search for a property for now.Girish Peswani, 44, Mumbai, IT consultantGot conned by a real estate broker who claimed to be working on behalf of a bank to sell a property that had turned into a bad debt. He paid an advance of Rs 1.5 lakh, which he never got back.Singed by the episode, Peswani has put his plans of buying property as investment on hold.Had the Peswanis done their investigation before they handed over the cheque, they would have realised that brokers appointed by banks for selling repossessed property do not have the authority to collect advances. Arun Ramamurthy, Co-Founder, Credit Sudhaar, cautions, “Brokers don’t have any other role to play other than marketing. They can’t charge a rupee from the investor. They are paid a fee by the bank or the Asset Reconstruction Company (ARC) after the deal is closed.”Further, details of such auctions are published in at least one English newspaper and one vernacular newspaper. Interested investors should look out for such advertisements, which will provide contact details of ARCs or lenders. “When a broker contacts you, double check with the ARC or bank he represents to rule out fraud. Always write out cheque in favour of lending institute or ARC,” says Ajay Oak, Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer, Shubham Housing Finance.The low level of financial literacy in India has spawned a huge opportunity for misselling and fraud. Senior citizens, who are not familiar with new investment products, and newbie investors who have no clue about financial markets, are the two most vulnerable segments. Mumbaibased Indula and Dhananjay Panchal were sold life insurance plans and Ulips at the age of 70. At an age when they should have been enjoying their hard earned money, the couple was saddled with 15 insurance policies and an yearly premium of Rs 19 lakh. Says Harshvardhan Roongta, Certified Financial Planner at Roongta Securities, “There is absolutely no need to buy life insurance after retirement. Ask yourself why you need insurance when you are not earning.”Dhananjay Panchal, 75, Mumbai, Retired doctorsThey were sold multiple life insurance policies and market linked products by their insurance agent when they were retiring. At 70, they had 15 life covers, for which they were paying a premium of Rs 19 lakh.After paying premiums for three years, they realised that the plans were not suitable and terminated them.Their loss is nothing compared to those suffered by Delhi-based retired couple Kulbhushan and Vinod Suri. The Suris were cheated of Rs 78 lakh by the relationship manager who used their cheques to invest in his own name for several years. The scam came to light when Kulbhushan applied for redemption and was told that the mutual fund receipt he had was fake. After the scam, SEBI changed the rules disallowing the use of third-party cheques for investments in mutual funds.Newbie investor Jinal Shah lost money when she invested in shares of a little known media company seven years ago. A friend had heard a TV discussion on the stock and recommended it to Shah, who promptly invested Rs 50,000 in the scrip. The investment is now lost because the company went into liquidation two years ago. Shah now does her own research before investing and buys stocks of well established companies. “Every advice to buy stock has to be vetted and researched before investing. Especially in rising markets, there is a temptation to buy on every rumour or advice,” says Dipen Shah, Senior Vice-President and Head PCG Research, Kotak Securities. This temptation should be resisted and one should buy only fundamentally sound stocks with credible management.Jinal Shah, 33, Mumbai, Finance professionalInvested Rs 50,000 in shares of a little known media company on the advice of a friend seven years ago. She lost all her money as the company closed down.Though she failed to get her money back, Shah made it a point to educate herself about equity analysis.Can investors do something to protect themselves against such horrible mistakes? For one, do not give away too many details of your finances. In Mandhana’s case, the relationship manager at the bank misused his access to a customer’s account details to mis-sell products.“Permission from customers should be mandatory before a relationship manager can access savings account details,” says Rohit Shah, CEO of financial advisory firm Getting You Rich. He advocates a separate advisory desk in banks to segregate operations and advisory.Similarly, Peswani did not bat an eyelid before issuing a cheque for a property even though he had not seen the papers. Goel’s relationship manager asked her for a personal loan. “When I refused saying I don’t have enough to spare, he pointed out that there was enough cash in my bank account,” she says. That’s when she realised that she had given away more information than required.Experts advise that you should never be too trusting. “As a rule, you should assume that everyone trying to sell a financial service is either hiding something or actively lying. Distrust and suspicion should be the default attitude,” says Dhirendra Kumar, CEO of Value Research. Look out for the obvious red flag in the sales pitch by the distributor.These obvious signs should alert investors against frauds:Steer clear of agents who try to hurry you into making a decision. Wait for at least 10-12 days before you issue a cheque. During that time, research the plan and seek second opinion.Only bonds, fixed deposits and some insurance policies can assure the returns they will give. If anybody is giving assurances on returns from market-linked products (Ulips, mutual funds, pension plans) he is lying.Just because a fund gave dazzling returns in the past two or three years doesn’t mean it will continue to do so in future as well. This is especially true at a time when markets are already at all-time high levels.It is the favourite ploy of real estate agents. Don’t believe it unless there are plausible reasons, like a new infrastructure project or improvement in the accessibility of a location.Ponzi schemes work on the simple principle. Investors get paid by getting more people to invest. When the scam becomes too big and they have made enough, the promoters vanish.Another common scam promises attractive payments for answering simple surveys. Any scheme that requires minimal work and promises extraordinary returns is obviously a fraud.Don’t be afraid to bombard financial salespersons with questions. Keep asking till you have understood what the product is all about. Also, don’t sign on the dotted line in the first meeting itself. Take time to understand the plan or investment and seek a second opinion from an independent source.Knowledge is your best weapon against cheating and fraudsters. Goel was lucky to come across a financial adviser who helped her gain knowledge of financial matters. Today, she is herself a financial adviser.Quitting should not be the option. After suffering losses in stocks, Shah did not shy from the equity markets. On the contrary, she learnt about equity analysis and is now a finance professional.Lastly, don’t shy from cutting your losses and starting afresh. After paying the premiums for a few years, the Panchals realised that the insurance policies they were sold benefitted the agent more than they helped them. The high premium (Rs 1.6 lakh per month) was also a cause of constant stress for the retired couple. After paying for three years, they approached a financial adviser who helped them exit the policies. The Panchals were able to identify the problem and fix their financial crisis.

(336, 'Market: The myth of real estate profits', 'The myth of real estate being a great investment is mostly a result of mathematical illiteracy about compound growth. People will tell you about how the value of a certain plot of land or house grew 50 or 100 times in 40-50 years. This sounds fabulous, but is actually nothing special. The BSE Sensex has become 300 times its value in 38 years. Even a gain of 100 times in 50 years comes to only 9.6% per annum, which is not exceptional. But even these gains in real estate could only have happened under the old model of real estate investment.They cannot happen now. Let''s try to understand where real estate returns came from historically. There are perhaps five sources of gains in the price of a given property, and the final profit is a product of these. First, the original change in usage of a piece of land from agricultural or barren to residential or commercial. Second, the development of physical infrastructure which makes this land usable for the new purpose. Third, the improvement in livability or commercial viability as the area becomes more and more populated. Fourth, the periodic booms and busts that afflict real estate, and fifth, the general inflation of the economy that becomes part of the visible change in the property''s price.When your parents'' generation bought property, they often did so at an early stage. As a result, all the gains from the second to the fifth point above accrued to them over two or three decades. Now, you typically buy an apartment from a real estate developer, and all gains from stage one to three accrue to him. What is even worse is that the developer also tries to capture much of the value of the later stages in advance from the buyer, and often succeeds in doing so. The intense marketing hype around real estate developments is intended to convince you that one day in the imminent future, the property you are buying will be among the most desirable in your part of country. Therefore, you must pay up now.To put things in investment terms, your acquisition price is at a high multiple of a value that will supposedly be attained in the far future. Therefore, the price of a property in South Mumbai or South Delhi may have grown 50 times in 50 years. However, the flat on the outskirts of these cities that someone is trying to convince you is worth `5 crore today is not going to be saleable for `250 crore in another 50 years, because the developer has factored in much of the future value into the current price.The real estate investment model has changed, and as far as the individual buyer is concerned, it has changed for the worse. Much worse.Therefore, it''s only logical that savers should buy only one house, the one in which they are going to live.

(338, 'Buyers won’t lose I-T sops for joint holding of house', 'MUMBAI: The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (Mumbai bench) has, in a recent order, held that if the entire investment for purchase of a new residential house, along with stamp duty and registration charges, has been made by an individual, he should get the full benefit of the relevant income tax (I-T) exemptions.Merely because the name of a close relative has been added to the newly purchased property (or in other words the new property is jointly held), it should not result in dilution of the I-T exemption in the hands of the individual who has paid for it.The I-T Act, under various sections, offers tax benefits where sale proceeds (such as sale of residential house) are reinvested in certain assets (such as another residential house or eligible investments). For instance, under section 54, if on sale of a residential house, the sale proceeds are reinvested in another house in India, within the stipulated period of time, to the extent of such reinvestment an exemption is available in computing capital gains. The taxable component of capital gains is reduced to the extent of the reinvestment, which results in a lower capital gains tax outgo.If you look up the name plates in your housing society, you may find that several flats are jointly held. The flat may be in the joint name of a couple, or owned with a parent or a sibling. The co-owner may or may not have contributed towards this purchase and the name of such a relative may have been added for the sake of convenience, such as to prevent family disputes arising in the future."The ITAT has upheld the well-established criteria that ownership for I-T purposes is determinant upon who has made the payment and to what extent. Very often, the name of a non-earning spouse, or parent or even sibling is added when a new property is purchased to offer a security net to them. In those cases, where they have not contributed towards the purchase, the I-T benefit, such as on re-investment should flow entirely to the buyer who had made the purchase. This aspect has been reiterated by the ITAT," explains Gautam Nayak, tax partner, CNK & Associates.In one case, decided by the ITAT on April 27, the taxpayer, Jitendra V Faria, had on sale of a residential house incurred capital gains of Rs. 43.01 lakh. He reinvested Rs 42.66 lakh in a new residential house and claimed this amount as exempt under section 54 of the I-T Act. On the deficit balance, of Rs 35,000 odd, he paid capital gains tax amounting to Rs 7,376. However, in the course of assessment, the I-T official noted that the new house that had been purchased was held in the name of two persons — Jitendra Faria with his brother Kunal Faria. Thus, the I-T official held that the exemption claimed by Jitendra Faria should be restricted to Rs 21.33 lakh (which is 50% of the amount claimed as exempt by him under section 54).When the matter reached the ITAT, the tribunal noted that the name of brother was included only for the sake of convenience. It observed that even the I-T official had confirmed that the entire cost of the new house was borne only by Jitendra Faria. Thus, the ITAT set aside the decision of the I-T authorities and decided in favour of the taxpayer.', '2017-05-08 15:31:10', 'i339.jpg', 3, 0.6, 'MUMBAI: The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (Mumbai bench) has, in a recent order, held that if the entire investment for purchase of a new residential house, along with stamp duty and registration charges, has been made by an individual, he should get the full benefit of the relevant income tax (I-T) exemptions.Merely because the name of a close relative has been added to the newly purchased property (or in other words the new property is jointly held), it should not result in dilution of the I-T exemption in the hands of the individual who has paid for it.The I-T Act, under various sections, offers tax benefits where sale proceeds (such as sale of residential house) are reinvested in certain assets (such as another residential house or eligible investments).Thus, the I-T official held that the exemption claimed by Jitendra Faria should be restricted to Rs 21.33 lakh (which is 50% of the amount claimed as exempt by him under section 54).When the matter reached the ITAT, the tribunal noted that the name of brother was included only for the sake of convenience.However, in the course of assessment, the I-T official noted that the new house that had been purchased was held in the name of two persons — Jitendra Faria with his brother Kunal Faria.For instance, under section 54, if on sale of a residential house, the sale proceeds are reinvested in another house in India, within the stipulated period of time, to the extent of such reinvestment an exemption is available in computing capital gains.The co-owner may or may not have contributed towards this purchase and the name of such a relative may have been added for the sake of convenience, such as to prevent family disputes arising in the future.', 3, 23, 62, 8, 1),

I don''t think that''s really a correct thing to do for a regulator. The price is under forbearance; both the top and bottom should be under forbearance.It cannot be that for customers you can raise as much as you want, but you can''t take it below a certain threshold," Sharma told ET.IUC is the charge paid by a caller''s operator to the receiving party''s operator. Jio''s free voice and data offers had helped the new entrant notch up 100 million subscribers in 170 days since its launch in early September.Since April 1, Jio has started charging for data but it has promised free voice calls for life for its customers, adversely impacting established competitors, who still earn 80% of revenues from voice.Sharma said Trai believes that unnecessary interventions don''t help. "In the long run, there should be a minimalistic intervention and regulation."Asked to comment on the slew of accusations and counter accusations being levelled by Jio and the incumbent telcos at each other, Sharma said there was competition in the industry."Sometimes it becomes a little shriller than what it should be, which seems to be the case here," he added.Trai has been accused by incumbent telcos of being biased in favour of Jio, an allegation the regulator has strongly denied.The telecom department had also waded into the controversy a few months ago when it blamed the sectoral watchdog for what it said was the deteriorating health of the sector.Sharma, however, said the overall health of the telecom sector was the primary concern of Trai."The telecom industry is very mature, vibrant, competitive, which is a good thing. I trust the wisdom of the players in this space, they''re mature enough to realise what is in their long-term interest," he added.Trai is currently in the midst of a slew of consultation processes, including one on the globally critical issue of net neutrality, a concept which guarantees a free and unbiased access to the Internet for all.Sharma said Trai will hold at least three open house discussions and consult experts and academicians on what is globally a hotly debated subject and come out with its recommendations by the first half of July."When we make recommendations, we will certainly be cognizant of what is being done internationally but at the same time, we will make appropriate recommendations which are good for our country," Sharma said, when asked to comment on the fact that the US is relooking its policy on net neutrality under the new regime.Trai will, within a couple of months, also start a consultation process on the pricing of 4G and 5G spectrum for the next round of auctions, after a reference sent by the government.He said that while the right time for auctions would be determined through the consultation process, a sale was possible this fiscal year, which ends on March 31, 2017."It (auctions) can happen (this FY). We will certainly give our (pricing) recommendations before December," Sharma said, adding the regulator will carry out a fresh consultative process on the pricing of all bands, including the coveted 700 MHz band used for 4G which went unsold in the last auction due to high reserve price.Sharma said the regulator was open to taking a relook at the base price.

So a free movement of goods and services was not possible. Now, the idea of GST was that let there be just one tax in the country,” Jaitley said.\n\nHe added that tax rates on goods may go down marginally under the new indirect tax regime while services may see some increase.\n\nThe GST Council, which had previously finalised a four- tier tax structure of 5, 12, 18 and 28%, is scheduled to meet next week to put different commodities and services in the decided tax brackets.\n\nDemerit and luxury goods will attract the peak tax rate plus a cess.\n\nTax rate closed to the existing incidence of total central and state levies will be chosen as the slab for a good or services.\n\n“As far as goods is concerned, the tax is not likely to increase at all. If at all, it may marginally come down because of the cascading impact not being there and therefore, it is not likely to be inflationary.\n\n“As far as services is concerned, obviously, they will go up marginally and therefore, there will be some impact on this. So, goods and services may react a little differently,” Jaitley said.\n\nAsked if GST would stoke inflation, he said: “I don’t anticipate this to happen significantly. If at all, this may be a transient impact.”\n\nAt a separate interactive session on ‘India’s Business Environment: Reforms and Opportunities’ organised by CII, Indian Embassy and Japan Chamber of Commerce, he said after the Constitution was amended by Parliament and supporting legislations passed, state legislatures are approving the respective State GST law.\n\n“Currently, that process is on. I see no difficulty in it,” he said adding GST rules have been framed and tax rates will be fixed at the GST Council meeting on May 18 and 19.\n\nJaitley sees no problems in rolling out GST from July 1.\n\n“Hopefully, from July 1, one of the largest tax reforms in India since Independence -- a simpler, more efficient and cleaner taxation system would be introduced in the country which itself would ease the very processes of doing business,” he said.\n\nAt the investors’ meet, he said there would be no cascading impact of tax on tax under GST.\n\n“GST being a more efficient tax, evasion will become difficult. In the current system, there is large evasion,” he said.\n\nJaitley said the constitutional amendment gives time till September 15 for introduction of GST but the target date has been kept at July 1.\n\n“So, we have a cushion of two-and-a-half months but it looks like we will be able to begin on schedule,” he said.\n\nAlso, a simple IT network has been put in place and there is no multiple forms for filing tax returns, he said.\n\nGST would be a “transformational” system, he said, adding “there could be some small hiccups in the beginning but I think it’s understandable. We will be able to get over this”.\n\nGST with a far more efficient system, Jaitley said, that will increase trade, tax collection and improve ease of doing business.', '2017-05-08 15:48:39', 'i349.jpg', 3, 0.45, 'Addressing CII-Kotak investors’ round table here, Jaitley said that the GST Council, headed by him and comprising representatives of all states, will in the next few days finalise the rates of tax for different goods and services and the country is on track to roll out the simplified indirect tax regime from July 1.The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is on schedule for implementation from July 1 and will not lead to any significant increase in prices of goods although cost of some services may see a marginal hike, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said today.“Hopefully, from July 1, one of the largest tax reforms in India since Independence -- a simpler, more efficient and cleaner taxation system would be introduced in the country which itself would ease the very processes of doing business,” he said.I see no difficulty in it,” he said adding GST rules have been framed and tax rates will be fixed at the GST Council meeting on May 18 and 19.At the investors’ meet, he said there would be no cascading impact of tax on tax under GST.', 3, 23, 62, 8, 1),
(349, 'Under governor Urjit Patel, RBI zooms in on 4% inflation target', 'Under governor Urjit Patel, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will target inflation of 4%, three officials familiar with its thinking said, adopting a narrower reading of its mandate than markets in a bid to stamp out rampant price rises of the past.\n\nThe differing interpretations of amendments to last year’s RBI Act reflect sometimes strained relations between the market and the central bank, and are proving a test for Patel some eight months into his tenure.\n\nThe amendments were part of landmark changes to India’s monetary policy pushed by Patel, then deputy governor, and his predecessor as governor, Raghuram Rajan, and require the RBI “to contain inflation within the specified target level” of 4%, but within a tolerated band of 2-6%.\n\nMarkets have interpreted that as the range of 2-6%, arguing that pursuing a specific 4 % target takes away the flexibility needed in an economy that must grow by at least 8 % a year to allow for full employment.\n\nBut the RBI is determined to chase the 4 % figure, the officials said, as Patel and the other five members of his monetary policy committee (MPC) seek to defend the RBI’s credibility on inflation.\n\n“Markets should read the Act carefully and think as if they are a member of the MPC, and then think: how would they conduct policy?” said one of the officials.\n\n“The Act clearly says 4 % is the target and the 2-6 % band has been given only to absorb temporary or one-time shocks.”\n\nAll three officials spoke on condition of anonymity, because they were not authorised to speak to the press on sensitive policy issues.\n\nThe RBI did not give official comment.\n\nSuch a stance could open the prospect of earlier interest rate hikes than expected by markets, should prices start to move higher unexpectedly and remain there for some time.\n\nThe officials stressed, however, that the RBI was also mindful of growth, in line with an Act that tasks the MPC with “maintaining price stability, while keeping in mind the objective of growth.”\n\nConsumer inflation stood at 3.81 % in March, but weaker-than-expected monsoon rains and planned hikes to government employee salaries could easily see the 4 % target under threat.\n\nBut any move to hike the repo rate of 6.25 % would need to be balanced by concerns among market participants that the economy is weaker than the 7.0 % growth in the October-December quarter, as India’s move last year to ban higher-valued bank notes continues to reverberate.\n\n“So far as the 4 % target goes, the MPC has to decide how to go ahead in a calibrated way, balancing out the costs associated with that stance,” said the second of the three officials.\n\nRBI versus markets\n\nThe pursuit of the 4 % target will likely continue to remain a source of disagreement between the RBI and some market players, even as investors begin to adjust to a more hawkish monetary policy.\n\nA Reuters poll last month showed only seven out of 38 economists expected a rate cut this year, down from 21 out of 36 earlier.\n\nHowever, Indranil Sengupta, economist and co-head of India Research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said inflation was “a long, long way” from becoming an issue since the economy has yet to accelerate meaningfully.\n\n“In our opinion there is a case for a 25 bps rate cut in August,” he said.\n\nThe differing views reflect how markets are still adjusting to the changes to the monetary policy framework over the past two years in a country with a history of volatile and double-digit inflation.\n\nPatel started his tenure by cutting rates in October, priming investors to believe he would soften his focus on inflation, only to then stun investors by changing the monetary policy stance to “neutral” from “accommodative” in February and adopting a much more hawkish tone.\n\nSince then, the 10-year benchmark government bond yield has risen about 50 basis points.\n\nThe officials defended the actions as consistent with the RBI’s views on the trajectory of inflation, which hit as low as 3.17 % in January.\n\nBut it has since accelerated, and becoming too tolerant could dent the bank’s credibility, the officials argued.\n\n“If people start doubting RBI’s credibility in controlling inflation, then producers will start raising prices, which in turn will push up inflation expectations.

They are among a growing number of lenders pushing ahead with plans to move operations from London.\n\nGoldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein said in an interview on Friday that London’s growth as a financial centre could “stall” as a result of the upheaval caused by Brexit.\n\nThirteen major banks including Goldman Sachs, UBS, and Citigroup have given an indication of how they would bulk up their operations in Europe to secure market access to the European Union’s single market when Britain leaves the bloc.\n\nTalks with financial authorities in Europe have been underway for several months, but banks are increasingly firming up plans to move staff and operations.\n\n“It’s full speed ahead. We are in full motion with our contingency planning,” said the head of investment banking at one global bank in London. “There’s no waiting.”\n\nAlthough the moves would represent about 2 percent of London’s finance jobs, Britain’s tax revenues could be hit if it loses rich taxpayers working in financial services.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies - a think tank focused on budget issues - said in a report on Thursday the rest of the population will have to pay more if top earners move.\n\nThe exact number of jobs to leave will depend on the deal the British government strikes with the EU. Some politicians say bankers have exaggerated the threat to the economy from Brexit.\n\nThe plans of large banks such as Credit Suisse and Bank of America and many smaller banks are still unknown.\n\nFrankfurt and Dublin are emerging as the biggest winners from the relocation plans. Six of the 13 banks favour opening a new office or moving the bulk their operations to Frankfurt. Three of the banks will look to expand in Dublin.\n\nDeutsche Bank said on April 26 up to 4,000 UK jobs could be moved to Frankfurt and other locations in the EU as a result of Brexit - the largest potential move of any bank.\n\nJPMorgan last week announced plans to move hundreds of roles to three European cities in the next two years. This is still significantly lower than the 4,000 figure JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon first estimated before the vote.\n\nEstimates for possible finance-related job losses from Brexit are on a broad range from 4,000 to 232,000, according to separate reports by Oliver Wyman and Ernst & Young.\n\nBanks are treading carefully, enacting two-stage contingency plans, to avoid losing nervous London-based staff as they work out how many jobs will have to eventually move.\n\nThis suggests that the numbers could potentially rise further depending on what deal is eventually negotiated between the EU and Britain.\n\nThis first phase involves small numbers to make sure the requisite licences, technology and infrastructure are in place, while the next will depend on the longer term strategy of a bank’s European business.\n\nThe Bank of England has given finance companies until July 14 to set out their plans.\n\nOne senior bank executive at a large British bank said forcing companies to make a plan makes it more likely that they will follow through.\n\n“It is an unintended consequence, but the more and more preparation you do the more likely you are to execute those plans,” the executive said.\n\nHSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver said this week that the bank’s previous estimate that around 1000 staff would move to Paris following Britain’s vote to leave the EU, was based on a ‘hard Brexit’ scenario.\n\nMost banks are working on the assumption that this is the most likely outcome of the separation talks and would involve losing access to the single market with no special financial services deal and no transition period.', '2017-05-08 15:51:28', 'i355.jpg', 3, -0.2, 'The largest global banks in London plan to move about 9,000 jobs to the continent in the next two years, public statements and information from sources shows, as the exodus of finance jobs starts to take shape.Deutsche Bank said on April 26 up to 4,000 UK jobs could be moved to Frankfurt and other locations in the EU as a result of Brexit - the largest potential move of any bank.Most banks are working on the assumption that this is the most likely outcome of the separation talks and would involve losing access to the single market with no special financial services deal and no transition period.The exact number of jobs to leave will depend on the deal the British government strikes with the EU.JPMorgan last week announced plans to move hundreds of roles to three European cities in the next two years.', 3, 23, 62, 8, 1),

In addition, plain packaging opens the door to newer, cheaper rivals.\n\nBig tobacco companies have argued that the impact of plain packaging in Australia can not be adequately discerned from the effect of a large excise tax increase.

Due to poor infrastructure, trucks here can manage to cover about 225 km a day compared to about 800 km a day in the US and 350 km in China.\n\nStressing on the need for warehouses, he said fruits and vegetables worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore rot every year as “we cannot store that”.\n\nMaking the point that the integrated approach will boost farmers as well, Gadkari urged Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu and Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju to ensure installation of stalls for products like oranges from Nagpur, Alphonso from Konkan, grapes from Nasik and flowers from Sikkim at railways stations and airports.\n\nSuch steps would not only ensure revenue for farmers, but boost sales, he said.\n\nThe minister said that the government plans to bring down logistics costs drastically to enhance exports and create huge employment.\n\nThe road transport and highways ministry plans to build 35 multi-modal logistics parks (MMLPs) in the country which will cater to 50% of the freight movement, enable 10% reduction in transportation costs and 12% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nLand parcels have already been identified and pre- feasibility studies initiated at six of these locations.\n\nThe parks will be developed jointly by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the National Highways Infrastructure Development Corporation (NHDICL) and respective state governments.\n\nThe government is also working on formulating a uniform policy for development of MMLP. It has identified sites for the proposed 35 logistics parks to be set up on railways, highways, inland waterways and airports transportation grid.\n\nFifteen such logistics parks will be constructed in the next five years, and 20 more over the next 10 years. These will act as hubs for freight movement allowing freight aggregation and distribution with modern and mechanised warehousing space.\n\nAn official said a joint venture will be set up between the NHAI and a partner which could be a state government with 49% and 51% stakes, respectively.\n\nAs per the plans, of the total land acquired for the project, 40% will be developed and returned to the land owner. Of the remaining, 20% will be sold to finance the project while the profit from the rest 40% will go to the NHAI.\n\nThe ministry has also sought infrastructure status for these logistics parks.', '2017-05-08 16:05:58', 'i381.jpg', 3, 0.75, 'An integrated policy is on the anvil to ramp up infrastructure at a time when India’s revenue receipts are set to touch the Rs 30 lakh-crore mark in the next two years, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Thursday.As per the plans, of the total land acquired for the project, 40% will be developed and returned to the land owner.“Post-demonetisation and GST regime, India’s revenue receipts are likely to touch Rs 28-30 lakh crore in the next two years coupled with steps to strengthen infrastructure,” Gadkari said.The road transport and highways ministry plans to build 35 multi-modal logistics parks (MMLPs) in the country which will cater to 50% of the freight movement, enable 10% reduction in transportation costs and 12% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.When the NDA government took over in 2014, the revenue receipts read Rs 13 lakh crore, which could scale up to Rs 20 lakh crore during the three years of the present regime, the minister pointed out.', 3, 23, 61, 8, 1),

It is very important to keep inflation expectations well anchored,” said the second official.', '2017-05-08 16:37:35', 'i400.jpg', 3, -0.25, 'But the RBI is determined to chase the 4 % figure, the officials said, as Patel and the other five members of his monetary policy committee (MPC) seek to defend the RBI’s credibility on inflation.“So far as the 4 % target goes, the MPC has to decide how to go ahead in a calibrated way, balancing out the costs associated with that stance,” said the second of the three officials.The officials stressed, however, that the RBI was also mindful of growth, in line with an Act that tasks the MPC with “maintaining price stability, while keeping in mind the objective of growth.”\n\nConsumer inflation stood at 3.81 % in March, but weaker-than-expected monsoon rains and planned hikes to government employee salaries could easily see the 4 % target under threat.RBI versus markets\n\nThe pursuit of the 4 % target will likely continue to remain a source of disagreement between the RBI and some market players, even as investors begin to adjust to a more hawkish monetary policy.But any move to hike the repo rate of 6.25 % would need to be balanced by concerns among market participants that the economy is weaker than the 7.0 % growth in the October-December quarter, as India’s move last year to ban higher-valued bank notes continues to reverberate.', 3, 23, 61, 8, 1),

(401, 'In defence of the Burkini: how to make conservative swimwear sexy!', 'Last year, we decided to take a family vacation to Bali, a place I had daydreamed about since reading the book Eat, Pray, Love with a sort of silent pining for the writerly life of Elizabeth Gilbert.\n\nIn my pre-vacation excitement, I Googled all about Bali, while also reaching out to friends for help. Much to my dismay, the girlfriends responded with how I must flaunt a ‘sexy bikini’. Before I left, a bunch of middle-aged ladies in my posh South Delhi parlour talked about getting a bikini wax; according to them, this is imperative on beach vacays.\n\n“I don’t have the body for a bikini. Besides, aren’t bikini waxes blindingly painful? And what’s this pressure to conform?” I snapped.\n\nA woman getting a pedicure leaned in, saying, “I went to Bali for my 50th. All my life, my husband forbade me from wearing a bikini. So I used to preserve cutouts from magazines, drooling over heroines in swimwear, including Sharmila Tagore. She was a real bomb. Bong, like you!”\n\nI shrugged.\n\n“My son Monty grew up hearing my mother-in-law and hubby telling me to cover up. So though his girlfriends, school and college mates indulged in pool parties, there was always a different set of rules for a daughter, wife and parent,” she adds.\n\n“I too grew conscious, put on weight and preferred swimming in tights and tees. But things changed when I turned 50. Our kitty decided on a Bali trip, and there we were. Twenty women in designer bikinis…some with transparent palazzo pants, some worn under chiffon capes or with long kaftans. It was a revolution. Bali set us free, beta.”\n\n“How? You were still covering up…still cowering to misogyny.” I cut her short.\n\nThe woman met my eyes. “Have you ever felt covering up is more liberating than baring it all? At 50, we were finally comfortable with our bodies. We shunned male control, but at the same time, we wanted to look and feel our best. I wasn’t hiding under my robe; my bikini was as sexy as anyone else’s. I showed what I wished to. The bikini is about balance…a deep, inner harmony.”\n\nA kaftan serves the purpose of a naked dress and will highlight certain areas of your body. On Devanshi: Swimwear kaftan, Amante; Shoes, Zara (Irina Usova)\n\nCover girls\n\nOur models are real women, who sizzled in style in conservative swimwear\n\nAs I listened, I thought about the noise made by mayors across 30 French coastal resorts that banned burkinis in 2016. (Burkinis cover the head, torso and limbs like a wetsuit with a hood.) The mayors refused to lift the restrictions, despite the country’s highest administrative court ruling that the bans were a “serious and manifestly illegal violation of fundamental freedoms.”\n\nIn the same year, sports goods retail chain, Decathlon, recorded a 70 per cent spike in sale of women’s swimwear after it introduced leg suits, tights and full-sleeved leg suits. Indian women who splashed about in suits with skirt-fronts or T-shirts with tights, were at ease in maillots: sleeveless one-piece swimsuits with high-cut legs.\n\nWas their slow graduation to the bikini a reason to flaunt their well-worked-out bodies? Or was the average Indian woman now customising the bikini to reflect her growing sense of identity – setting free from a cage that labelled any skin show as vulgar and slutty?\n\nDesigner Anupama Dayal, a leading name in the resortwear market, speaks of a gradual mindset transformation. “The indoctrination runs deep here, most women want to maintain the ‘good girl’ image,” she says. “When I was married, I too wore the one piece, seeking my husband’s approval. But when I was a divorced 40-year-old travelling to Turkey, I invested in a bikini for the first time. Today, I embrace the sea on my own terms.”\n\n“Even my Australian buyers claim women seek designs where the arms don’t show, so we team a bikini with a cape/robe. ”\n\nA one-piece swimwear comprises tank top and shorts. Wear it if you like the athletic look minus the frills. (Left) On Devanshi: Tank top with matching swim shorts, Kunchals; Shoes, Zara.

(Right) On Marija: Two-piece swimwear, Amante (Irina Usova)\n\nShow and tell\n\nUndoubtedly the Indian swimwear market is becoming part of a more vibrant fashion industry, with consumers demanding fit, comfort and value for money, along with more stylish, sexy cuts.\n\nNarresh Kukreja of the designer swimwear/resortwear label Shivan & Narresh says, “The top trend was the one shoulder maillot. It was elegant, provided the right support, and was not too sporty, just right for women across the broad 25-55 years category. In the case of the two-piece, the high-waisted 1960-70 bathing suit is still going strong, as it covers optimally, while showing a little midriff.”\n\nNarresh says different cities exude different sensibilities. Delhi women are conservative about cleavage, cut-outs and bare legs, and less reserved about their bare backs, unlike Mumbai women or those in Chennai, who aren’t afraid of flaunting their curves. Women in Kolkata, known for their sensuality, are comfortable with front and back show, and since they travel abroad frequently the consumption of swimwear there is supposedly soaring.\n\nA swimsuit can be worn with a sarong if you’re bottom-heavy but are not afraid to flaunt your curves and arms. On Marija: Swimwear with sarong, Kunchals; Sunglasses, Vogue Eyewear. (Irina Usova)\n\nNarresh blames the standardised American and European sizes, that were earlier available, for taking a toll on the Indian woman’s self-confidence. He also points out how we as a culture have slowly steered away from size-zero worship, with women idol-worshipping Rihanna and Beyoncé, in a generation that thrives on selfies and an innate narcissism.\n\n“Swimwear and lingerie constitute the most shoppable category, and let’s not forget the ? 800-crore wedding industry – where swimwear belongs to the honeymoon trousseau,” he adds.\n\nI think of the lady in the beauty parlour and compare her to one of my readers, a 30-year-old, single Muslim woman in Pune, who recently shared a Facebook post on how easy access to modest swimwear on e-commerce sites helped her take up swimming. Sehr, a PR professional, wears knee-length tights and a maillot, taking a dip in the pool minus the awkward stares.\n\nA one-piece swimwear with matching skirt is a good outfit idea if you’re at a pool party and want to dance around freely, and just have fun.

I can swim freely as I’m not obsessed with the thought of how I look. There’s nothing not feminist or non-secular about choosing the burkini,” she says.\n\nAs an Indian woman who nurses something of a complex for growing up as a fat child, I ask myself if the acceptance of the bikini is a result of our liberation or our aspirations to fit in?\n\nWhether it stands for change or continuity? Whether I should’ve just got one in Bali and combined it with a kaftan?\n\nI ask myself if the bikini isn’t a straightforward symbol of feminine perfection.\n\nI ask myself if the bikini is a rebellion.

(402, 'Now... it’s all about loving the children: Karan Johar’s first interview after becoming a father', 'To get Karan Johar to bare his soul, you must have coffee with him. I do that on Good Friday afternoon, at his Dharma Productions office in suburban Mumbai. But the man sitting opposite me, dreamily sipping a tall, cold Caffe Frappuccino, is not Sunday night’s stylishly-attired hotshot impresario of India’s most watched celebrity chat show. Karan looks zoned out. And sleep deprived.\n\nHe was on “paternity leave”. And he hadn’t stepped into the office since March 28. His twin babies Roohi and Yash Johar, born two-and-half months prematurely on February 7, were discharged from hospital on March 29. And overnight the ‘Unsuitable Boy’ turned into ‘Superstar Dad’. The babies had taken over his life. They are now his world. I don’t think Karan, otherwise a notorious workhorse of a filmmaker and arguably Bollywood’s most inveterate party animal, has been out much in the last 18 days. Or thought about work. He quite simply has his hands full at home.\n\nThis is unprecedented for Bollywood’s most celebrated producer and director. The staff at Dharma, and his mother Hiroo Johar, used as they are to Karan’s “non-stop mad energy” (as Shah Rukh Khan put it), are amazed at the change. But he’s in office today because a high-powered team from Amazon Studios is knocking on Bollywood’s doors. With that out of the way, Karan sat down for the mother of all chats with me – yes, pun intended.\n\nI don’t know what he offers his guests on Koffee with Karan, given that he sips Diet Coke himself out of a coffee cup. I have regular machine-made coffee from Dharma’s pantry. I’ve been warned that the honest and outspoken Karan doesn’t want to talk about fatherhood. He’s just 66 days into the role. But Bollywood’s newest and most extraordinary single parent enthusiastically has answers even for the questions I don’t ask. He is a doting father and a fussy mother. He only interrupts our conversation five times to take calls from the twins’ paediatrician. So I sit back and enjoy my coffee while the proud papa does all the talking...\n\n‘This is my biggest blockbuster’\n\nFor Karan Johar, now it is all about loving the children. (Sayan Mukherjee)\n\n“My life has changed since Roohi and Yash arrived. At 44, this is my biggest blockbuster. I still haven’t realised the enormity of what’s happened. They’re only two months old. And all they do is eat, sleep, burp, wail and poop. Kabhi khushi, kabhie gham! While I stare at them in wonder. But I can’t get over the fact that they are mine. It’s like a powerful switch has suddenly come on in my life, filling the emptiness in my personal space with new energy. I get teary-eyed just looking at them. It’s surreal to think of them as my daughter and son. It’s daunting even, but in a gorgeous way, when I wake up suddenly at night to remember that I have life breathing in the next room that I’m totally accountable for. My universe was Dad, Mom and films. But now there are Roohi and Yash. My two new friends.\n\n“I’m going to bring Roohi and Yash to the office. Why not! Aren’t they productions of Dharma Productions? . I want them to be all over the place.”\n\nWhen they were born, I knew that my work, travel and social commitments would take a backseat because I’d want to give them unconditional love, care and attention. And now that they are home, I cannot stay away from them for long. It’s only been hours since I’ve been away, and look at me! I’m sharply aware of the time, I keep looking at my phone, because it’s the channel to my kids. I’ve decided that as soon as they are old enough, and before they start school, I’m going to bring Roohi and Yash to the office. Why not! Aren’t they productions of Dharma Productions? I want everybody here to know them. I want them to be all over the place. And I’m already looking at building a crèche here. It will be like Disneyland! I’m also looking forward to them travelling with me when I go outstation on shoots. Bebo’s son Taimur is a few months older than Roohi and Yash, and she and I have already started making plans for holidays together!”\n\nAn emotion-packed welcome home\n\n“The day they came home from the hospital is an experience that’s going to stay etched in my memory. Like the premier of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in 1998. It was my first film and I still remember every moment. What I wore. What I said. The day I carried Roohi and Yash home was like that. Life changing. Actually, it was a full on K3G moment! Very dramatic. With my Mom proudly standing at the door like Jaya Aunty holding a puja thali with burning diyas to welcome not her bahu – but her grandkids, all my aunts crowded behind her. I took my babies straight into the room where my father’s picture is placed. When I saw their reflection in the glass, merging with his image, I closed my eyes in gratitude and experienced the awe of the moment. I knew they had his blessings. These are scenes out of a film but drawn from real life. For me, that was a moment of faith. But it was only the trailer. Picture abhi baki hai!\n\n“I took my babies straight into the room where my father’s picture is placed. When I saw their reflection in the glass, merging with his image, I closed my eyes in gratitude and experienced the awe of the moment.”\n\nFatherhood is proving to be a breathtaking rollercoaster ride. When they were conceived, I was ecstatic, but I told myself I would be a responsible father and not a paranoid mother. Then came the complexities of premature birth. And the heartache of seeing them in the incubator. But I felt a strong sense of ownership. They were my lifelines. A lifelong dream come true. And I couldn’t wait to take them in my arms. When I did that for the first time, it was incredible. I knew this was the beginning of a different kind of love story. The start of the best phase of my life. Mothers go through these emotions. Fathers come in later. But I was there right from the start, with the other mothers in the ICU whose babies were also born weighing less than 1.5 kilos, their vital body parts, their tiny lungs and heart underdeveloped. And each time a baby crossed 2 kilos and the nurses put up a smiley sunshine face announcing this, I would celebrate with their mothers because I fully empathised with them.”\n\n‘Who’s to tell me that I can’t be a responsible parent? ’\n\n“I have an entire library of books on baby care. I haven’t read any of them!” (Rohan Shrestha)\n\n“A single father is unusual in India. There are some famous single fathers in the world, celebs who were brave to have babies out of surrogacy, like Cristiano Ronaldo and Ricky Martin. But I wasn’t inspired by them. Or by anybody. I know Tusshar Kapoor took the step first. And what he did was amazing. But by the time his son Laksshya was born, my procedure had also started. I feel connected to Tusshar by our common decision. You can’t be inspired by anybody to have a baby out of surrogacy. You have to be emotionally ready. I was also prepared mentally, physically and logistically.\n\n“I was ready for fatherhood. But was I prepared for twins? I was ready for triplets!”\n\nAt 40, I wasn’t ready. But two years ago, I decided I needed to bring this new energy into my life. I didn’t want to be a victim of my achievements. It’s easy to get carried away by who I am. But I never wanted to be defined by my professional successes. I thought I had lived half my life, and all the things I had done were great, but what about things I hadn’t done? Your achievements are transitional. Emotions are permanent. I had been thinking about having a child for a long time. And I knew I had the capacity to be an adequate parent. I’ve nurtured so many people in the film industry, so many young actors, I’ve been like a parent to them more than a producer and director. I’ve been with them in their professional highs and their emotional meltdowns. But I played devil’s advocate with myself. Was I being selfish? Did I want to have a child only because I was afraid of growing old alone? Would I be an overprotective and overindulgent father because I wouldn’t want my child to accuse me of being a flawed parent and grow up missing a mother? But who’s to tell me that I can’t be a responsible parent, and the best mother and father in the world to my kid? This was an emotional, well-thought-out decision made after acknowledging and addressing all the issues facing me, and after considering all the responsibilities and duties that come with being a single parent. I was ready for fatherhood. But was I prepared for twins? I was ready for triplets!”\n\n‘I introduce every visitor to Roohi and Yash by name .’\n\nKaran feels he could give paranoid mothers a master class. (Sayan Mukherjee)\n\n“Now, of course, my babies are the superstars of my universe. Ever since they came home, I’ve been like a mother, a father and a well-behaved housewife. People have been dropping in non-stop to see them, they come in shifts, and I’ve been running around serving them tea and snacks. Alia Bhatt comes every other day and sits for hours. I’m not paranoid about people wanting to hold my babies. Roohi and Yash are not royalty and meant to be stared at from behind a glass window. But I insist they sanitise their hands and take off their footwear first. Babies absorb energy. I like to think they are making eye contact with everyone but they’re just looking into oblivion. I like to imagine they are smiling in recognition but actually they’re just passing gas! The love and support I’m getting from friends who are family is phenomenal. Everybody feels a sense of responsibility towards me and mine. Even old friends who have reconnected with me after their birth. Everybody says they are now so happy for me. I’m surprised. I didn’t know so many people were unhappy for me earlier! I wish I had known. I was living a life of delusion thinking everything was great. But I would have enjoyed a moment of self-pity.\n\n“People have been dropping in non-stop to see them, they come in shifts, and I’ve been running around serving them tea and snacks. Alia Bhatt comes every other day and sits for hours.”\n\nI introduce every visitor to Roohi and Yash by name. ‘This is your Chacha and this is your Bua!’ I give them all a family tag. I want my babies to know that their family is large. It’s not just Mom and me, though my mother is my biggest support. She’s had multiple surgeries for the spine, for her hips, knees, she’s been in and out of hospital constantly. But you should see her now. Full of zing! She’s up early, fully made up and with her hair done, ready to face a new day with her grandkids. I’ve never seen her looking younger than she is today.\n\nI want all the help I can I get. I have an entire library of books on baby care. I haven’t read any of them! But I listen to all the advice mothers give me. I’m on several WhatsApp baby groups. Everybody has their own gyan. And I’ve received about 3,000 suggestions already. On paediatricians, nurses, how to make the nursery adaptive, what music to play for them – Baby Mozart or Baby Beethoven – dude, when did all this happen? – or simple nursery rhymes, which formula is best – Nan Pro, Similac or Enfamil, how to burp them, monitor their temperatures, when to take them for their immunity shots, what to do if they have nappy rash, what to do when they cry, I listen to everybody and then take my own decisions. I could give paranoid mothers a master class! People ask if I’m a hands-on parent. Do I change my babies’ nappies? I think this is overrated. It doesn’t add up to anything. Changing nappies is not going to go into their energy streams. I don’t remember my parents changing mine. But I remember being held and hugged. Even then, I did it once. The first time Roohi and Yash came home, because I felt it would be great if I was able to clean up their mess. But it was like ticking an inbox! I don’t want to be that kind of hands-on parent when I can be a fulltime heart-on father and mother!”\n\nFrom HT Brunch, May 7, 2017\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/HTBrunch\n\nConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch', '2017-05-08 17:29:36', 'i403.jpg', 5, 2.55, 'But who’s to tell me that I can’t be a responsible parent, and the best mother and father in the world to my kid?I was ready for triplets!”\n\n‘I introduce every visitor to Roohi and Yash by name .’\n\nKaran feels he could give paranoid mothers a master class.When I saw their reflection in the glass, merging with his image, I closed my eyes in gratitude and experienced the awe of the moment.”\n\nFatherhood is proving to be a breathtaking rollercoaster ride.I want them to be all over the place.”\n\nWhen they were born, I knew that my work, travel and social commitments would take a backseat because I’d want to give them unconditional love, care and attention.“People have been dropping in non-stop to see them, they come in shifts, and I’ve been running around serving them tea and snacks.', 3, 23, 61, 8, 1),

She works at an insurance company, rides a bike in a burkha, smokes pot and orders psychedelic mushrooms online. Saeed lives with his parents, works for a company that designs billboards and meets Nadia at an evening corporate class. As their romance blossoms, their city is ravaged by war – buildings fall prey to bombs, there are retaliatory air strikes, phone signals are lost and internet connectivity suspended.

I also take it personally, as somebody who’s lived a lot of his time in America and Britain. For mongrelized, hybridized people like me, these walls that are coming up between countries are terrible as it makes it impossible to connect the two parts of yourself. Also, after I moved back to Lahore eight years ago, the horrors that have happened in Syria and other places make a part of your mind say ‘what if it happened here?’ I wanted to explore this through a kind of first love – a love between two people who are young and changing very rapidly.\n\nThere’s an interesting depiction of technology in the novel, from drones and surveillance cameras to almost necessary objects like cell phones.\n\nIn many ways, the doors themselves are about technology. We live in a world where technology is making geographical distances disappear. Somebody in Lahore can watch a TV show set in Bombay or Los Angeles, and somebody there can watch footage coming from Lahore or Bombay. In each of our houses, we’re being thrust into other countries and worlds, and the doors are about that. Also technology is shaping who we are as human beings, how we connect, how we fall in love, how we find our way, how we migrate. So both, our dependence on technology and its potential to connect and monitor us are all themes in the book.\n\nYou’ve spoken about globalization being a brutal phenomenon… bringing mass displacement, wars, xenophobia, but also the freedom to reinvent ourselves. Having lived in different countries, how have these global experiences shaped you?\n\nIt’s almost impossible for me to think of who I am, separate from having lived in so many different places. I’m not any one thing. And I write like that, I live in Lahore and I am Pakistani but I cannot claim to represent Pakistan or Pakistanis. And I can’t claim to represent America or Britain. So partly, I’m a foreigner everywhere. Each of us, in our own ways, don’t fit in, whether you’re a liberal person in a conservative family or vice versa or a gay child in a family that’s uncomfortable with homosexuality. Every human being participates in this sense of foreignness, which I think is an essential aspect of being a human being.\n\nExit West offers stark truths about our increasingly fragmented world\n\nWhat led you to move back to Lahore eight years ago? Have you had to creatively restrict your writing because of certain laws?\n\nIt’s hard to generalise about life in South Asia. I live next door to my parents and my children play with their grandparents every day. And that’s how I grew up. I don’t know what it is to be desi or Pakistani but this kind of multi-generation extended family living is much more common here than it is in places like New York or London. To have my children and parents in the same place was the most important reason to move back.\n\nThe interesting thing about restrictions is they don’t necessarily stop creativity. In many instances, they encourage it because you have to be creative to get around them. That’s why sufi poets were writing stuff that could not be expressed in prose four thousand years ago. Reality is a kind of restriction and fiction is a reaction to that. Right now, when I look at India, I think it seems to be making some of the same mistakes that Pakistan has made, which are terrible mistakes. We allowed the oppression of minorities, the rise of a single state-sanctioned ideology, religious chauvinism, oppression of pluralism and victimization of human rights. It’ll probably take Pakistan a generation to get out of the mess we’ve created for ourselves. Seeing this, one would expect India to not want to go down that path. But it is, to a certain extent. Just like Pakistani writers have responded to an oppressive political climate here, Indian writers are responding and will continue to respond to an oppressive political climate in India.\n\nTell us about your relationship with India. When did you last visit?\n\nI have a lot of friends in Delhi and love Bombay. My wife and I often say that if the politics were better, we would spend a lot of time in Bombay because it’s the most cosmopolitan city in South Asia. I’ve been coming to India off and on for 30 years, I came and played soccer here with my school team in the late ’80s and then on book tours. Unusually for me, I haven’t come on a book tour for Exit West and part of the reason for that is the very sad state of the current Indo-Pak relationship. I’m hopeful that in some months, things will be better and I can come there. My wife and I watched The Lunchbox recently and it was wonderful. I’m not a huge Bollywood fan but I’m certainly a fan of Indian writing. Some of my best and closest writing friends are Indians, like Suketu Mehta, who I often stay with when in New York.\n\nYou recently said that your need to write fiction comes from the inability to entirely accept our world as it is. Do I sense a kind of disillusionment?\n\nWell, yes, disillusionment and desire. At some very deep level, I would like there to be a borderless world, where people could move wherever they wanted to move. I think something like that will eventually come to exist. The nation state and its huge role in all of our lives is a temporary political phenomena. It wasn’t there a thousand years ago and it probably won’t be there a thousand years from now. I find borders to be strange, frustrating. Why can’t someone in Delhi hop in a car and visit me in Lahore? Why can’t somebody in Lahore hop on a plane and see their cousin in New York? My desire to imagine a world that’s different certainly informed this novel.\n\nIs there a message you hope readers take away from Exit West?\n\nI hope they have an emotional experience with it, which informs how they think about issues of migration, refugees and change how the world is going to have to adapt to the future. I don’t want them to walk away saying migration is great, we love refugees, get rid of borders. I want them to be less frightened of the future, and although the future will be very different, human life is basically transient. And we can find beauty in transience. We don’t have to have to frightened by it.\n\nWhat fiction does in a political space is it allows readers to have these emotional experiences around particular characters and stories. And this experience is a different encounter with politics than the kind of theoretical encounter you have with an op-ed. I don’t think of Exit West as my manifesto which will galvanise the world. A book by itself does not catalyse a huge change. It’s part of a larger cultural movement, like a wave in the ocean. All of those waves together have the effect of washing up on a particular beach or making a particular cliff crumble. It’s important for all of us to think about these issues in different ways, and this is my part.\n\nFollow @TheCommanist on Twitter\n\nFrom HT Brunch, May 7, 2017\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/HTBrunch\n\nConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch', '2017-05-08 17:30:31', 'i404.jpg', 5, -0.1, 'I hope they have an emotional experience with it, which informs how they think about issues of migration, refugees and change how the world is going to have to adapt to the future.It’s important for all of us to think about these issues in different ways, and this is my part.Also, after I moved back to Lahore eight years ago, the horrors that have happened in Syria and other places make a part of your mind say ‘what if it happened here?’ I wanted to explore this through a kind of first love – a love between two people who are young and changing very rapidly.I don’t know what it is to be desi or Pakistani but this kind of multi-generation extended family living is much more common here than it is in places like New York or London.My wife and I often say that if the politics were better, we would spend a lot of time in Bombay because it’s the most cosmopolitan city in South Asia.', 3, 23, 61, 8, 1),

(409, 'World Thalassemia Day: Can the disease affect pregnancy?', 'Every year, May 8 is observed as World Thalassemia Day across the globe. This time doctors have aimed to encourage blood donation and spread increased awareness to women carrying the gene to protect their unborn child. Thalassemia, refers to a spectrum of genetic blood disorders characterised by reduction in the synthesis or absence of haemoglobin in the body.\n\nPeople with this disease produce lesser amounts of healthy haemoglobin throughout their life, and their bone marrow could even stop producing healthy red blood cells at a certain point in their life. This inherited disorder can range from being mild to severe in nature, depending upon the type and manifestation of the symptoms associated with the disorder.\n\nBeing informed about the disorder is not a guarantee on preventive or corrective measures for the unborn child. (Shutterstock)\n\nAccording to a WHO report, more than 90 percent patients with thalassemia in western countries lead a normal life, whereas in India, roughly half of all patients die before reaching adulthood.\n\n• 3.9 percent of India’s population is a carrier for thalassemia\n\n• Understanding the implications of thalassemia on pregnancy is the need of the hour, say experts\n\nClinical evidence suggests that if you or your partner carries the trait (alpha or beta) for thalassemia, there is a high risk that your baby may inherit the disease. Additionally, stress and low immunity levels during pregnancy can make the symptoms of thalassemia worse in most women, leading to a series of other physical and mental health implications.\n\n“Contrary to existing myths in our society, thalassemia is never acquired from contact or from the environment. Thalassemia is inherited, meaning that at least one of your parents must be a carrier of the disease. It’s caused by either a genetic mutation or a deletion of certain key gene fragments. The disease tends to run through families and is autosomal recessive disorder. Genetic studies have shown that even if only one parent has got the traits of thalassemia minor, there are up to 50% chance of having a child with thalassemia minor. Again, if both parents are thalassemia minor carriers, the chance of having a child with thalassemia major can be as much as up to 25%,” said Dr. Anil Kumar Dhar, Senior Consultant, Oncologist, Venkateshwar Hospital.\n\nBeing informed about the disorder is not a guarantee on preventive or corrective measures for the unborn child. Things like pre-natal counseling and tests in understanding the possible complications will help in this matter. By getting detected early, pregnant women and their partners can take important decisions regarding pregnancy.\n\nDr. Amitabha Ghosh, Columbia Asia Hospital, Gurgaon shared,”Both thalassemia major and minor can now be diagnosed as well as differentiated not only by conventional clinical methods and blood testing, but also with specialized molecular tests which permit accurate diagnosis, even before the baby is born. If you are already pregnant and both partners are having thalassemia minor, a prenatal diagnostic test is always recommended to find out whether the unborn baby has thalassemia major. Babies should be tested at birth for such genetic problems, and all people (and not only mothers) planning to have a child must get tested to see if they carry thalassemia traits. Ideally, thalassemia should also be checked before marriage to ensure a better future for both partners.”\n\nThis time doctors have aimed to encourage blood donation and spread increased awareness to women carrying the gene to protect their unborn child. (Shutterstock)\n\nDepending on the type and stage of thalassemia, women may be referred to a specialist team throughout the pregnancy period.\n\n“Thalassemia is genetic disorder in which there is a defect in the oxygen carrying capacity of the Red Blood Cells. If it is minor in nature, it may not result in any major complications. When the defects are more severe, it may impair the pregnancy from happening or lead too abortions or it may result in severe defects in the new born baby. The mother’s folic acid deficiency results in neurological problems in baby. Female patients with low haemoglobin should be evaluated for iron deficiency anaemia and thalassemia. If she is diagnosed with thalassemia, her husband should also be checked for it”, noted Dr Rajesh Kumar, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine, Paras Hospitals, Gurgaon.\n\nGlobally, approximately 15 million people suffer from thalassemic disorders every year. In India, it has been estimated that 10,000-12,000 children are diagnosed with this disease annually. On an average, one out of every 25 Indians is a carrier of thalassemia. Owing to the ignorance and lack of proper awareness, many people in India do not opt for diagnosis on time and hence ends up transferring the faulty genes to their children, research suggests.\n\nOf all the people, 50 % die before the age of 20 due to poverty and lack of treatment. Reportedly, about four million Indians are thalassemia carriers and over 1,00,000 patients. Iron overload is a common complication of thalassemia syndromes which could lead per se to the development of organ damage and increased mortality.\n\nFigures show that six out of 100 Indians are carriers of the mutated thalassemia gene.

A new enzyme pill can offer relief', 'With more and more people avoiding any wheat-based foods that might have uncomfortable side effects, the market for gluten-free foods has exploded in recent years, but a unique enzyme pill promises to change all of that.\n\nResearchers have found that taking an enzyme tablet while consuming foods containing gluten prevents a significant amount of it from entering the small intestine. This could enable gluten-sensitive patients to ingest small quantities of gluten without experiencing symptoms, such as bloating, diarrhea and abdominal pain.\n\nThe encouraging results from the enzyme known as aspergillus niger-derived prolyl endoprotease (AN-PEP) were presented at Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2017.\n\n“This substance allows gluten-sensitive patients to feel safer, for example, when they are out with friends at a restaurant and can’t be sure whether something is 100% gluten-free,” said lead author Julia König from the University of Örebro, Sweden. “Since even small amounts of gluten can affect gluten-sensitive patients, this supplement can play an important role in addressing the residual gluten that is often the cause of uncomfortable symptoms.”\n\nGluten intolerance is a disease that deteriorates with time and once it leads to a severe health condition, it is difficult to pull a patient back. (Shutterstock)\n\nThis is the first study involving a normal meal: 18 self-reported gluten-sensitive patients ate a porridge that included two crumbled wheat cookies containing gluten. They also took either a high dose or low dose of AN-PEP, or a placebo. Researchers then measured gluten levels in the stomach and small intestine over the course of three hours.\n\nThe study found that AN-PEP, in both high and low doses, broke down gluten in both the stomach and the first part of the small intestine, or duodenum. In the stomach, gluten levels in both the high- and low-dose groups were 85% lower than in the placebo group. Once the food reached the duodenum, gluten levels were reduced by 81% in the high dose group and 87% in the low dose group versus placebo.\n\n“Studies show that even when following a gluten-free diet, unintentional gluten intake can still occur, depending on how strict a gluten-free dieter is,” added König. “Our results suggest that this enzyme can potentially reduce the side effects that occur when gluten-sensitive individuals accidentally eat a little gluten. We are not suggesting that AN-PEP will give these individuals the ability to eat pizza or pasta, sources of large amounts of gluten, but it might make them feel better if they mistakenly ingest gluten.”\n\nKönig noted that her team did not test the enzyme on celiac disease patients, because even small amounts of gluten can cause long-term harm in these individuals. Because of that, she does not recommend celiac patients view this enzyme as a way to start eating any gluten.\n\nFollow @htlifeandstyle for more', '2017-05-08 18:01:34', 'i413.jpg', 5, -0.1, 'The study found that AN-PEP, in both high and low doses, broke down gluten in both the stomach and the first part of the small intestine, or duodenum.In the stomach, gluten levels in both the high- and low-dose groups were 85% lower than in the placebo group.“Since even small amounts of gluten can affect gluten-sensitive patients, this supplement can play an important role in addressing the residual gluten that is often the cause of uncomfortable symptoms.”\n\nGluten intolerance is a disease that deteriorates with time and once it leads to a severe health condition, it is difficult to pull a patient back.We are not suggesting that AN-PEP will give these individuals the ability to eat pizza or pasta, sources of large amounts of gluten, but it might make them feel better if they mistakenly ingest gluten.”\n\nKönig noted that her team did not test the enzyme on celiac disease patients, because even small amounts of gluten can cause long-term harm in these individuals.Once the food reached the duodenum, gluten levels were reduced by 81% in the high dose group and 87% in the low dose group versus placebo.', 3, 24, 61, 8, 1),

This year, official Festival partner Dessange Paris is celebrating the glamorous world of movies by channeling classic styles from icons of the big screen.\n\nAn official partner of the Cannes Film Festival for more than three decades, Dessange Paris heads to the French Rivera town each year to style hair for a host of big screen stars, wowing the waiting crowds and photographers as they walk the famous Palais des Festivals steps.

Hair is dried with the head upside down with a large round brush and a hairdryer on medium heat,” explains the Dessange expert.\n\nThe twist à la Grace Kelly\n\nFashion icon and cinema star Grace Kelly perfectly embodies this retro style, which is updated to create another modern classic for Cannes 2017. It may be an updo, but this style keeps hair low, showing off the face and highlighting features with a twisted vintage-style roll, channeling masculine and feminine vibes, glamor and the height of chic. “From a post-war style, this updo is subtly twisted around the face and fixed in place at the nape of the neck,” explains Dessange studio stylist Claudia Zocco.\n\nFollow @htlifeandstyle for more.', '2017-05-08 18:03:02', 'i417.jpg', 5, 0.55, 'An official partner of the Cannes Film Festival for more than three decades, Dessange Paris heads to the French Rivera town each year to style hair for a host of big screen stars, wowing the waiting crowds and photographers as they walk the famous Palais des Festivals steps.High-volume blow-dry à la Hedy Lamarr\n\nSophisticated style is sure to be on the agenda for this 70th edition of the Cannes Film Festival, including one of most glamorous trends -- the silky high-volume blow dry -- creating an impression of movement.The low chignon à la Marion Cotillard\n\nSweeping hair away from the face in a chic, glamorous style with a romantic twist, the low chignon is definitely in the spirit of the Cannes Film Festival.“I twist several strands of hair from the lengths with wax and fix them one by one at the base of the ponytail,” explains the stylist.“From a post-war style, this updo is subtly twisted around the face and fixed in place at the nape of the neck,” explains Dessange studio stylist Claudia Zocco.', 3, 24, 61, 8, 1),

It can take days or weeks to appear, and although it is not painful nor itchy, it is the first stage of Lyme disease.\n\nIf left untreated, the infection can become worse and spread to joints, the heart and the nervous system. However, most cases of Lyme disease can be treated successfully with a few weeks of antibiotics.\n\nHow can it be prevented?\n\nPreventing tick bites can prevent Lyme disease, as well as other tick-transmitted diseases.\n\nTo avoid bites, keep arms and legs covered with long clothing when out in the countryside, use insect repellent and reduce time spent in areas where ticks live, in particular long grass, humid undergrowth, prairies, meadows and fields.\n\nOnce home, check your body for ticks, in particular areas such as armpits, folds of skin, the scalp and the navel.\n\nHow can I remove a tick if I find it?\n\nThe tick needs to be removed as soon as possible to avoid infection.\n\nUse a pair of fine-tipped tweezers or a tick-removal tool from a pharmacy to grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible. Then, pull it upwards with steady, even pressure and without twisting it, which can cause parts to break off and remain in the skin. If this happens, remove with tweezers, or if you are having difficulty, leave it and let the skin heal.\n\nAfter removing the tick, clean the bite area with rubbing alcohol, an iodine scrub or soap and water.\n\nIf you’ve spent time in areas where ticks live, in particular long grass, check your body for ticks once home.

Here’s how', 'With sedentary lifestyle being one of the biggest reasons causing infertility, doctors say consumption of artificially sweetened sodas and aerated drinks may also lead to infertility in humans. Aerated drinks contain an artificial sweetener, aspartame, which can disrupt the endocrine system leading to hormonal imbalance and infertility issues in women.\n\n“Almost all of the soft drinks and sodas contain aspartame which is linked to many health problems including infertility, malformations and miscarriages,” said Arvind Vaid, an IVF expert at Delhi-based Indira IVF. “Excess consumption leads to hormonal imbalance and fluctuation that causes ovulatory disorders and even worsens PMS (Premenstrual symptoms),” he added.\n\nStating that phenylalanine and aspartic acids are the two amino acids present in aspartame considered natural and harmless when eaten in combination with other amino acids, the experts said when they are taken unaccompanied, it stimulates the generation of free radicals which leads to cell death. “Sperm and ovum, being cells, have 90 per cent chances of dying when this is consumed in excess. It is advised by many doctors and experts to avoid anything that helps in the formation of free radicals in the body for the significance of reproductive health,” said Vaid.\n\nRachna Jaiswar, associated with Gynaecology Department of Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said consumption of sugary aerated drinks restrains the immune system causing weight gain and hormonal imbalance, which strongly contributes to fertility issues. “Soda is a highly acidic beverage, which alters the pH level of the body with excess consumption,” said Jaiswar.\n\nDue to lack of nutrients in a high pH atmosphere, sperm cells either get harmed leading to its abnormal shape and poor quality or eventually die, say experts. (Shutterstock)\n\nTalking about the high consumption of aerated drinks and sodas by men, Jaishwar said due to lack of nutrients in a high pH atmosphere, sperm cells either get harmed leading to its abnormal shape and poor quality or eventually die. “Moreover Bisphenol-A (BPA), a chemical that reduces the male semen quality, is found in the lining of plastic bottles and most canned goods. Men who consume soft drinks more often are at 4 times the risk of lowering their sperm count, motility and concentration,” said Jaiswar.\n\nDoctors also said most of the soft drinks are caffeinated and contain fructose, which are associated with a higher risk of ovulatory disorders and infertility among women. “Caffeine is known to be a vasoconstrictor that reduces uterine blood flow thereby reducing menstrual bleeding and shortening the duration of menses.

Researchers from University of Washington (UW)in the US collected data from about 2,000 reviews of popular period tracking apps, surveyed 687 people and conducted in-depth interviews with a dozen respondents.\n\nNearly half of the survey respondents used a smartphone app to track their periods for a variety of reasons: to understand their body and reactions to different phases of their cycles; to prepare for their periods; to achieve or avoid pregnancy; or to inform conversations with healthcare providers.\n\nResearchers focused on nine different period tracking apps, and on what characteristics users liked or disliked. They found that while some apps were more successful in meeting users’ needs, none were perfect. Women participants found the modelling assumptions used in some period tracking apps were not accurate or flexible enough to consistently predict their menstrual cycles, particularly when their periods were not regular.\n\nMany apps do not allow users to correct them when the predictions are wrong or to input data or explanations about why a particularly stressful month or change in birth control might have thrown off their cycles, researchers said. “In some cases, you do not have a way to go in and say I missed my period because of x reason or because I was in the hospital - both ordinary and exceptional circumstances can mess up the algorithms because they are not really robust,” said Nikki Lee from UW. “The apps are most accurate if your cycles are really regular, but the people who most need an app are the people whose cycles are not regular,” Lee said. Apps rarely allow women to customise results or how they are presented. Someone who is trying to avoid getting pregnant or to prepare for their period, for instance, might want an app to provide a more generous window for predicting when they are ovulating or when their period will arrive so they are not surprised, researchers said. Someone trying to become pregnant would likely want the app to zero in on a narrower span of time when their chances of ovulation are highest, they said.\n\n“People did not feel like the apps were very good at supporting their particular needs or preferences. People felt they were better than tracking their periods on paper, but still were not great in a lot of basic ways,” said Daniel Epstein, from UW. “One significant issue is that few apps are transparent about explaining their methodology or limitations,” said Julie Kientz, associate professor at UW.\n\nIn working with healthcare providers on a teen health app, she learned that teenage girls were relying on smartphone apps as their primary form of birth control to tell them when they should avoid having sex. “That’s pretty disconcerting because accuracy can be a problem with these apps,” Kientz said.\n\nFollow @htlifeandstyle for more', '2017-05-08 18:04:21', 'i421.jpg', 5, 0.55, 'Someone who is trying to avoid getting pregnant or to prepare for their period, for instance, might want an app to provide a more generous window for predicting when they are ovulating or when their period will arrive so they are not surprised, researchers said.Nearly half of the survey respondents used a smartphone app to track their periods for a variety of reasons: to understand their body and reactions to different phases of their cycles; to prepare for their periods; to achieve or avoid pregnancy; or to inform conversations with healthcare providers.Women participants found the modelling assumptions used in some period tracking apps were not accurate or flexible enough to consistently predict their menstrual cycles, particularly when their periods were not regular.Many apps do not allow users to correct them when the predictions are wrong or to input data or explanations about why a particularly stressful month or change in birth control might have thrown off their cycles, researchers said.“In some cases, you do not have a way to go in and say I missed my period because of x reason or because I was in the hospital - both ordinary and exceptional circumstances can mess up the algorithms because they are not really robust,” said Nikki Lee from UW.', 3, 24, 61, 8, 1),

Scientists blame it on lack of a protein skin barrier', 'Deficiency of a protein that acts as a skin barrier is responsible for triggering eczema -- an itchy inflammation of the skin, scientists said.\n\nAtopic eczema is a common skin condition and often found in children in the first year of their life and persists into adulthood with severe itching that has profound effects on well-being and may lead to sleep disturbance. The findings showed that the lack of protein filaggrin impacts other proteins and pathways in the skin, which in turn drive the development of eczema. “We have shown for the first time that loss of the filaggrin protein alone is sufficient to alter key proteins and pathways involved in triggering eczema,” said Nick Reynolds, Professor Dermatology at Newcastle University in England. “This research reinforces the importance of filaggrin deficiency leading to problems with the barrier function in the skin and predisposing someone to eczema.”\n\nFor the study, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (JACI), the team developed a human model system. Using molecular techniques, the upper layer of the skin (epidermis) was modified, to become filaggrin-deficient, as observed in the skin of patients with atopic eczema. The model enabled the researchers to discover proteins and signalling pathways directly down-stream of filaggrin, and most importantly, identified a number of key regulatory mechanisms.\n\nThese included regulators of inflammatory signalling, cell structure, barrier function and stress response.

The world of food is more exciting than ever before. New restaurants are coming up offering novel cuisines or digging out old ones. Chefs are looking at unusual ingredients and dramatic ways of presenting food. Meanwhile, some wizened old experts continue to wield magic with their skewers and ladles in remote parts of the city. There is a world waiting to be discovered or re-embraced– new cooking styles, world food, sub-regional cuisine and tiny holes in the wall which produce the most delightful dishes. Here’s a guided tour.\n\nWhen I was a young lad – in those prehistoric times when the Internet was still a dream and the television largely stuck to agriculture – my Sunday mornings consisted of a long walk from Rafi Marg to Daryaganj. I would browse through the books being sold on the pavements, and after having picked up a few well-thumbed volumes, I would amble up to Chawri Bazaar. There, my first stop was Shyam Sweets, where I had an early lunch – a plate of bedmi and aloo sabzi, which on Sundays came with a special pumpkin side dish.\n\nThe shop has been there since 1910, and was started by a gentleman called Anandimal Baburam who came from Allahabad to Delhi. The eatery is now run by the fifth generation of the family, notably two brothers called Sanjay and Ajay Aggarwal.\n\nOne of the landmarks of Delhi, it serves breakfast fare, sweets and the snacks that you need to fill yourself with at teatime, or even for dinner. The mornings are reserved for bedmi aloo -- bedmi being a much loved puri layered with a paste of urad dal. It is served with a mildly spiced potato curry, lightly cooked chholey and a dollop of some tart fenugreek (methi) chutney. And on Sundays, you’ll get a helping of the old pumpkin sabzi that had me hooked.\n\nI think this was the first eatery in Old Delhi that I ever visited. On Bud Shah Bullah lane, the T junction of Chawri Bazaar and Nai Sarak, the shop was then a nondescript little place, behind which was a well which gave you water that was wonderfully cold and sweet. Water to the houses in the neighbourhood went from this well, I am told. Now it has been walled up.\n\nShyam Sweets has also expanded over the years. They have added counters around which people stand and eat. Apart from bedmi aloo, it is also known for its muttar kachoris which are sold in the evenings. The bedmis get over by 2 pm, and the cooks then get ready to fry the pea-filled kachoris.\n\nYou bite into your bedmi or kachori, and take a swig from a tall glass of frothy lassi. If you want to end your meal with something sweet, you could try out the rabri, rasmalai, or the ghiya ki launj – which is a delicious sweet prepared with bottle gourd.\n\nOne of the most endearing aspects of Old Delhi is the fact that you can leave home with a 100-rupee note, and actually return with some change. A plate of bedmi aloo with 2 bedmis is for 40, and if you want four pieces of nagori with halwa added to it, the meal comes for Rs 50. Nagori is a small puffy disc, prepared with flour and semolina. You make a small hole in it, fill it with halwa and then eat it.\n\nAnd the other remarkable fact is that these once-little-and-now-big eateries have withstood the onslaught of time. Though Ghantewallah, a sweet shop set up in 1790, closed down in 2015 , many of the old food places are still going strong.

Also, after I moved back to Lahore eight years ago, the horrors that have happened in Syria and other places make a part of your mind say ‘what if it happened here?’ I wanted to explore this through a kind of first love – a love between two people who are young and changing very rapidly.\n\nThere’s an interesting depiction of technology in the novel, from drones and surveillance cameras to almost necessary objects like cell phones.\n\nIn many ways, the doors themselves are about technology. We live in a world where technology is making geographical distances disappear. Somebody in Lahore can watch a TV show set in Bombay or Los Angeles, and somebody there can watch footage coming from Lahore or Bombay. In each of our houses, we’re being thrust into other countries and worlds, and the doors are about that. Also technology is shaping who we are as human beings, how we connect, how we fall in love, how we find our way, how we migrate. So both, our dependence on technology and its potential to connect and monitor us are all themes in the book.\n\nYou’ve spoken about globalization being a brutal phenomenon… bringing mass displacement, wars, xenophobia, but also the freedom to reinvent ourselves. Having lived in different countries, how have these global experiences shaped you?\n\nIt’s almost impossible for me to think of who I am, separate from having lived in so many different places. I’m not any one thing. And I write like that, I live in Lahore and I am Pakistani but I cannot claim to represent Pakistan or Pakistanis. And I can’t claim to represent America or Britain. So partly, I’m a foreigner everywhere. Each of us, in our own ways, don’t fit in, whether you’re a liberal person in a conservative family or vice versa or a gay child in a family that’s uncomfortable with homosexuality. Every human being participates in this sense of foreignness, which I think is an essential aspect of being a human being.\n\nExit West offers stark truths about our increasingly fragmented world\n\nWhat led you to move back to Lahore eight years ago? Have you had to creatively restrict your writing because of certain laws?\n\nIt’s hard to generalise about life in South Asia. I live next door to my parents and my children play with their grandparents every day. And that’s how I grew up. I don’t know what it is to be desi or Pakistani but this kind of multi-generation extended family living is much more common here than it is in places like New York or London. To have my children and parents in the same place was the most important reason to move back.\n\nThe interesting thing about restrictions is they don’t necessarily stop creativity. In many instances, they encourage it because you have to be creative to get around them. That’s why sufi poets were writing stuff that could not be expressed in prose four thousand years ago. Reality is a kind of restriction and fiction is a reaction to that. Right now, when I look at India, I think it seems to be making some of the same mistakes that Pakistan has made, which are terrible mistakes. We allowed the oppression of minorities, the rise of a single state-sanctioned ideology, religious chauvinism, oppression of pluralism and victimization of human rights. It’ll probably take Pakistan a generation to get out of the mess we’ve created for ourselves. Seeing this, one would expect India to not want to go down that path. But it is, to a certain extent. Just like Pakistani writers have responded to an oppressive political climate here, Indian writers are responding and will continue to respond to an oppressive political climate in India.\n\nTell us about your relationship with India. When did you last visit?\n\nI have a lot of friends in Delhi and love Bombay. My wife and I often say that if the politics were better, we would spend a lot of time in Bombay because it’s the most cosmopolitan city in South Asia. I’ve been coming to India off and on for 30 years, I came and played soccer here with my school team in the late ’80s and then on book tours. Unusually for me, I haven’t come on a book tour for Exit West and part of the reason for that is the very sad state of the current Indo-Pak relationship. I’m hopeful that in some months, things will be better and I can come there. My wife and I watched The Lunchbox recently and it was wonderful. I’m not a huge Bollywood fan but I’m certainly a fan of Indian writing. Some of my best and closest writing friends are Indians, like Suketu Mehta, who I often stay with when in New York.\n\nYou recently said that your need to write fiction comes from the inability to entirely accept our world as it is. Do I sense a kind of disillusionment?\n\nWell, yes, disillusionment and desire. At some very deep level, I would like there to be a borderless world, where people could move wherever they wanted to move. I think something like that will eventually come to exist. The nation state and its huge role in all of our lives is a temporary political phenomena. It wasn’t there a thousand years ago and it probably won’t be there a thousand years from now. I find borders to be strange, frustrating. Why can’t someone in Delhi hop in a car and visit me in Lahore? Why can’t somebody in Lahore hop on a plane and see their cousin in New York? My desire to imagine a world that’s different certainly informed this novel.\n\nIs there a message you hope readers take away from Exit West?\n\nI hope they have an emotional experience with it, which informs how they think about issues of migration, refugees and change how the world is going to have to adapt to the future. I don’t want them to walk away saying migration is great, we love refugees, get rid of borders. I want them to be less frightened of the future, and although the future will be very different, human life is basically transient. And we can find beauty in transience. We don’t have to have to frightened by it.\n\nWhat fiction does in a political space is it allows readers to have these emotional experiences around particular characters and stories. And this experience is a different encounter with politics than the kind of theoretical encounter you have with an op-ed. I don’t think of Exit West as my manifesto which will galvanise the world. A book by itself does not catalyse a huge change. It’s part of a larger cultural movement, like a wave in the ocean. All of those waves together have the effect of washing up on a particular beach or making a particular cliff crumble. It’s important for all of us to think about these issues in different ways, and this is my part.\n\nFollow @TheCommanist on Twitter\n\nFrom HT Brunch, May 7, 2017\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/HTBrunch\n\nConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch', '2017-05-08 18:12:22', 'i427.jpg', 5, -0.1, 'I hope they have an emotional experience with it, which informs how they think about issues of migration, refugees and change how the world is going to have to adapt to the future.It’s important for all of us to think about these issues in different ways, and this is my part.Also, after I moved back to Lahore eight years ago, the horrors that have happened in Syria and other places make a part of your mind say ‘what if it happened here?’ I wanted to explore this through a kind of first love – a love between two people who are young and changing very rapidly.I don’t know what it is to be desi or Pakistani but this kind of multi-generation extended family living is much more common here than it is in places like New York or London.My wife and I often say that if the politics were better, we would spend a lot of time in Bombay because it’s the most cosmopolitan city in South Asia.', 3, 24, 61, 8, 1),

(430, 'The importance of making the right retirement plan', 'My cousin is on a bit of a high these days. Both literally and metaphorically. Her dream house in the mountains, with a spectacular view from every window, is finally coming together. The woodwork is done, the plumbing works, the furniture is in place, the curtains have been hung and the kitchen is on its way to being fully functional.\n\nThis is where she intends to retire when her work is finally done. Living blissfully among the clouds, breathing the fresh mountain air, cooking the vegetables she grows in her own back garden, going for long walks, spending endless afternoons reading and drinking green tea.\n\nIt sounds like an idyllic retirement, doesn’t it? Well, I guess it does to most people. But when she showed me the pictures of the house and the view – both amazingly beautiful – and told me of her plan, the first thought that popped into my head was: “Where is the nearest hospital?”\n\nNo, of course, I didn’t actually say that out loud. That’s not the kind of thing you say when someone you love announces the fulfilment of the dream of a lifetime. Stamping down on that voice in my head, I went through all the pictures and told her how spectacular it looked – and it truly did.\n\nWhen I think of my own retirement plans, the one thing that takes precedence over all else is the proximity of medical services\n\nBut all the while I was making the right noises I was thinking about logistics. How long it would take to get to a doctor? How she would negotiate the steep climb up if – well okay, when – her knees went?\n\nInstead of voicing these concerns, however, I restricted myself to encouraging her to persuade her sister and brother-in-law (both doctors) to buy a house nearby so that they could serve the tiny community’s medical needs.\n\nYes, I know, I sound like a complete nutcase. But the truth is that when I think of my own retirement plans, the one thing that takes precedence over all else is the proximity of medical facilities. I would never dream of moving to a faraway village in the hills, no matter how lovely, if I wasn’t sure that there was a good hospital a short ambulance ride away.\n\nThe other thing that I am obsessed about is having a single-level house. I have done my share of duplex living, trudging up and down from bedroom to living room and back again. But as my knees begin to twinge every time I walk down a staircase and my heart rate goes up when I walk back up, I have come to realise that I can’t keep this up for long. In another two decades I will need a living space that allows me to shuffle slowly from one room to another, without negotiating any steps along the way.\n\nAnd where would I like this home to be located? Well, having being born and bred in one big city and lived in several others, I know that country pleasures are not for me. Don’t get me wrong. I enjoy a trip to the beach as much as the next person. I love to take a break in the mountains when the heat in the plains gets too much. I read, I sleep, I take long walks, I revel in the natural beauty, I unwind, I detox, I de-stress. I slow my life down, tune out the static so that I can hear myself think. I get in touch with myself.\n\nBut after a week of this enforced calm, I start to get itchy. The quiet seems to weigh heavy upon me. I start to miss the energy and excitement of the big city. I begin to long for a visit to the cinema, a quick trip to the shops, eating out at my favourite restaurants, meeting up with friends, catching an exhibition, attending a music recital, or just sitting at a coffee shop, sipping an excellent cappuccino and watching the world go by.\n\nAll of which leads me to believe that I would not enjoy a retirement spent in the mountains or beside a beach. The truth is that I only ever feel truly alive while living in a big city. A city that keeps me engaged through night and day, through the seasons, and indeed, through the years.\n\nA city where there are enough public spaces where I can spend an hour or two with friends, with a good book, or even by myself. A city dotted with museums and monuments, where you can drop by when you want a sense of the past that shapes our present. A city that hosts everything from plays, art exhibitions, musical evenings to seminars and international conferences, to keep your brain stimulated in the best possible way. A city with enough beautiful green areas so that taking a walk doesn’t seem like drudgery. A city that is safe enough for a single woman to negotiate on her own, no matter how late she is getting back home.\n\nAt the moment, the city that best fits the bill is Delhi – with its verdant Lodhi Garden, its amazing monuments like Purana Qila and Humayun’s Tomb, and the full menu of programmes at such venues as India International Centre and Habitat Centre. The only area where it falls short is on women’s safety. But with luck, by the time I am old and doddering, that problem will be sorted out.\n\nUntil then, I live on a hope and a prayer in my one-level apartment, a stone’s throw away from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). And take comfort in the fact that at least medical help is only a (very) short ambulance ride away.\n\nFrom HT Brunch, May 7, 2017\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/HTBrunch\n\nConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch', '2017-05-08 18:13:43', 'i431.jpg', 5, 1.35, 'But the truth is that when I think of my own retirement plans, the one thing that takes precedence over all else is the proximity of medical facilities.When I think of my own retirement plans, the one thing that takes precedence over all else is the proximity of medical services\n\nBut all the while I was making the right noises I was thinking about logistics.But when she showed me the pictures of the house and the view – both amazingly beautiful – and told me of her plan, the first thought that popped into my head was: “Where is the nearest hospital?”\n\nNo, of course, I didn’t actually say that out loud.The woodwork is done, the plumbing works, the furniture is in place, the curtains have been hung and the kitchen is on its way to being fully functional.I love to take a break in the mountains when the heat in the plains gets too much.', 3, 24, 61, 8, 1),
(431, 'Vir Sanghvi revisits his best meals of 2017', 'By May, last year, I had travelled so widely and eaten so many delicious large meals that my iPhone was overflowing with food photos.\n\nBut this has been a quiet and sedate year. There has been relatively little foreign travel, few famous chefs and not that much in the way of glamorous dining. But my TV work has kept me on the road (only in India, though) and so there have been some fun meals.\n\nSo here, relying on my iPhone’s photo gallery and Instagram, are some of my most memorable meals and dishes from the months gone by.\n\nITC Grand Bharat, Gurugram: I started my New Year with pudding. The Queen of Puddings is a ‘traditional British dessert’, which is a nice way of saying that it has custard, jam and breadcrumbs and is best suited to end-of-term dinner at a nursery school.\n\nBut since I love nursery puddings, I love the Queen of Puddings too. Sadly, very few pastry chefs bother with it (they are too busy looking for Valrhona chocolate and making poncy patisserie). Fortunately the Grand Bharat puts it on the menu of the India Room as their special pudding. I had it on New Year’s Eve, and was still wolfing it down when they rang in 2017. Delicious.\n\nThe Queen of Puddings is a ‘traditional British dessert’, which ITC Grand Bharat has put on the menu of the India Room as their special pudding.\n\nConrad, Pune: In mid-January, I found myself booked into a less than wonderful hotel in Pune for a conference. I escaped from my gloomy room and went for dinner to the Conrad where Mandar Madhav, who I knew from Mumbai, is the chef, hoping that his food would cheer me up.\n\nMandar made me home-style Malvani food to his mother’s recipes and it was so amazing that I went back to my hotel, checked out at once and moved into the Conrad for the rest of my stay.\n\nThe bonus was that even the desserts were terrific. The Conrad is a great discovery; Pune’s smartest hotel.\n\nIndian Accent, Delhi: Eating Manish Mehrotra’s food is always a privilege. On this occasion, Manish was collaborating with Sabrina Gidda, a British-Indian from London who has won praise for her modern Italian cuisine. Sabrina’s food (with lots of truffles) was great but who can match Manish when he makes his famous Daulat Ki Chaat (still Delhi’s best dessert) and such dishes as a starter of Papri Chaat constructed mock pizza style?\n\nToast & Tonic, Bengaluru: A few days later I was in Bengaluru at Manu Chandra’s Toast & Tonic. As you would expect with Manu, the food was amazing. But this time it was also surprising because he used traditional grains, home-cured meats and the like. My favourite was his jowar roti with a filling of fresh kathal.\n\nProof that you don’t need fancy ingredients to make good food.\n\nTaj Exotica, Maldives: Two days later I was at the Taj in the Maldives where my old pal chef Sheroy Kermani demonstrated that he was at home with both fancy and local ingredients. His Tajima Wagyu was melt-in-the-mouth delicious. But he also thinly sliced the local tuna and seared it quickly to give us an authentic taste of the Indian Ocean.\n\nAt Taj Exotica, Maldives, the thinly-sliced and seared local tuna gives an authentic taste of the Indian Ocea\n\nHyatt, Amritsar: Work has taken me to Punjab again and again over the last three years. So I am quite happy to debate the virtues of Ludhiana’s food as compared to Amritsar’s, if you like.\n\nBut I never expect to get great Amritsari khana at a deluxe hotel. So I was stunned when the Hyatt turned out Amritsari kulchas that had a dhaba chhaap. I was intrigued enough to try and discover how they had managed to reproduce street-style flavours in a hotel kitchen. The answer was simple enough: they had lured a star cook away from one of the top dhabas by offering him a Hyatt salary!\n\nHyatt Amritsar turns out Amritsari kulchas that have a dhaba chhaap\n\nLuk Kai Thong, Bangkok: This is not grungy enough a place to have any street cred (it is at an upmarket mall) nor is it fancy enough to attract foreigners and tourists. But I like it because the food is delicious and different, the ingredients are first rate and I am usually the only non-Thai there.\n\nMost things on the menu are great but the Steamed Blue Crab (with a chilli-lime dip) is to die for.\n\nGaggan, Bangkok: Yes, I know. You are fed up of Indians who come back from Bangkok swearing by Gaggan’s food. So I won’t bore you with the whole meal. But if you do go, try the tandoori quail. It is the most tender, delicate bird you will ever eat.\n\nMeatlicious, Bangkok: Gaggan’s cheaper, non-fancy place (well, technically it belongs to his wife) serves the best value Japanese steaks in Bangkok, thanks to a deal he has with a Japanese breeder. But on this visit, the show was stolen by a plate of local, hard-to-find (mussel-style), shellfish cooked to a recipe Gaggan made up on the spot.\n\nSaffron, Mumbai: Nobody talks about this much but the Indian restaurant at the Juhu JW Marriot does Lucknowi food that is in the Dum-Pukht league. The Shahi Tukra, however, is even better than the Dum-Pukht version\n\nThe Shahi Tukra at Saffron restaurant in Juhu JW Marriot is even better than the Dum-Pukht version\n\nSoam, Mumbai: I can’t really go to Mumbai and not eat at Soam. If they just gave me the kadhi-bhaat and those delicious khichri papads (made from rice) that would be enough for me. But of course, I always end up eating the bhel and the dahi batata puri.\n\nAnisa’s samosas, Bengaluru: I wrote some months ago about these Kutchi Memon samosas that you order from a catering service run by a talented cook called Anisa. Well, I’ve been to Bengaluru twice since then and each time I have ordered her keema samosas and brought them back to Delhi with me. A real find.\n\nThe Druid Garden, Bengaluru: This is the sort of restaurant that could only exist in Bengaluru. It is a huge New York-style space hidden away in a residential building with a multicuisine menu. You have to know that it is there to find it. The key to the high quality of the food is the passion of the owners. Order the crab, if you go, but there are many, many other options – all at reasonable prices.\n\nAvartana, Chennai: Avartana is ITC’s modern Indian food brand. It should have opened by now (at Chennai’s Grand Chola). I went for a preview and was blown away by the food. One dish should give you an idea of what to expect: lobster and scallop with a ghee candle on a bed of gunpowder. As the candle melts, the ghee mingles with the gunpowder to create a spicy sauce.\n\nDharshan at the Four Seasons, Mumbai: Dharshan Munidasa in Sri Lanka’s greatest chef. Of his many restaurants, two are rated in the Asia Top 50, and because he is half-Japanese and half-Lankan he knows how to combine flavours from all over Asia. He came to the Four Seasons for a Gourmet Festival and the night I went, he did his signature crab dish and some new style sushi.

(432, 'Look, your voice assistant', 'I’ll admit it. That headline you see on top is pure click bait. But unlike typical click bait fodder, which is a sinful combination of some truth and some imaginative twists given to it, this one is unfortunately the whole truth. Your all-new voice assistant device helps you handle your daily life, obeys your every command, takes a selfie, advises on how you’re looking, gets you professional dressing tips from stylists and also spies on you all day without you knowing it. Think about all that you do in the area you dress up, in your bedroom and as you come out after taking a shower. Now, don’t think about it! See it in cinemascope technicolour full HD as it’ll all be recorded and kept stored and will be accessible to god knows who all!\n\nBionic ears\n\nYes, the Amazon Echo has gained a camera. A really good one! For those who are unaware or have been living under a stone for the last few years; the Amazon Echo is a small cylindrical device that has an array of microphones that hears all your commands and answers them with a built-in assistant called Alexa. Ask it to add an appointment, read out your calendar, play a song, update your shopping list, hail an Uber cab, update you about traffic and about a million other things and Alexa responds quickly and intelligently. And now, Alexa of the good ears also has sprouted eyes. Big beautiful ones that can do things no voice assistant has done before.\n\nAmazon Echo Look has a great camera that can shoot fantastic pictures, take selfies or even a video\n\nFirst, the good stuff\n\nThe next generation of Amazon Echo is called Echo Look, and it now has a fantastic camera that can really look deep into your life. Ask it to take a selfie, a video, blur out the background so that you and your clothes truly stand out, twirl around and look at yourself full length back to front in real-time, ask it for advice on two different outfits and get immediate analysis from top stylists, look at every outfit you’ve worn in the last few months and never repeat anything inadvertently and a dozen other things too. It’s basically an intelligent mirror and clothes horse dream – all rolled into one. The already over-amplified world of selfies gets an even bigger boost. Ask for a selfie or video to be uploaded to Instagram or take more nude selfies for Snapchat without the awkward angles of holding a phone in the hand or get Alexa to record your next self-celeb porn video without any costly equipment to install. The mind boggles to think of the potential of this device and technology.\n\nAnd now, the reality check\n\nThe mind also boggles at the incredible abuse, surveillance and privacy issues devices like this create. Amazon has thoughtfully given an on/off button for the camera, but that only serves to underline the problem. Hacking into webcams on laptops and phones has always been rated as the easiest of the lot. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, FBI Director James Comey and almost every top executive at security agencies in India and abroad cover their laptop camera with black tape! The reason – cameras that are online and can stream or send videos can be easily hacked into. At least laptops can be taped off. But this device is a different ball game. This will be specially bought and placed in a very private area with the purpose of that camera being used multiple times a day. Deliberately and by choice. The day is not far when the website www.badsexcaughton-echolook.com has billions of videos online including yours.\n\nWhile Amazon has given an on /off button in the Echo Look, hacking into webcams on laptops and phones has always been rated as an easy job. That’s why, all top executives cover their laptop camera with tape\n\nCamera sense\n\nSo why would Amazon go down this path? Well, for one, its actually a great idea and it’s a fantastic use of technology. It’s also the next logical step in the evolution of digital assistants, a business worth billions in the next few years. But there’s more to it. The clothing business is worth 2.4 trillion dollars worldwide and Amazon wants a big piece of that fashion pie. It’s already the biggest retailer of fashion in USA and wants that market everywhere, including India. And in fashion, data is king and the kind of data a device like this will generate for Amazon makes them Supremo Emperor! Images and videos gathered by Echo Look will be stored on the company’s cloud. Permanently. Amazon now gets its hands onto tonnes of visual data, knows your taste and makes recommendations. You’re going to give all this information voluntarily and, even pay for it.\n\nIsn’t it uncanny that almost every new breakthrough technology seems to have an even more frightening pound of flesh payment back into the system? That shiny little gizmo that you can’t wait to get your hands on.

(436, 'The truth is out there: Tales from India’s UFO investigators', 'I. Midnight Special\n\nAt the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world slept, Sunita Yadav awoke to a levitating alien.\n\nShe watched, petrified, as it hovered a foot above the ground just behind her home. Standing over 4ft tall, with grey skin and big, black eyes, it proceeded from the Yadavs’ backyard toward their front door before – as her son Hitesh remembers – it “just vanished”.\n\nIn the 15 years since, the humanoid has made numerous other appearances around the Western Command Hospital in Panchkula, some 10 km away from Chandigarh.\n\n“It’s now a mascot. Residents in the area believe it’s lucky to spot it,” says Hitesh, 20, now a tech student living in Gurgaon.\n\nIn their sketch, the alien looks like a swarthy dwarf. But Hitesh remains convinced that what he saw was an extraterrestrial. And he spends much of his free time trying to prove it.\n\nHitesh runs the free bi-monthly e-zine UFO Magazine India, is developer of the Ufology App and founder of Disclosure Team India, which investigates UFO sightings and encounters in the country.\n\n“Disclosure has grown to 200 members since it was set up in January 2016, including 22 from the US and UK,” he says. The website has a form where people can report their sightings in detail.\n\nThis form has been filled four times. “But our investigators hear many stories from locals on the ground,” he stresses.\n\n“I’m currently researching an alien abductee case in Chhattisgarh,” Hitesh says. “I don’t care what people think, because my parents and sister are accepting. But my relatives don’t know what I do. If they did, they’d surely call me crazy.”\n\nHitesh Yadav, 20, is a tech student at a Gurgaon college. He believes he saw an alien as a child. In his free time, he runs the free e-zine UFO Magazine India. He is also the founder of Disclosure Team India, which investigates UFO sightings and encounters in the country. They currently have four cases under investigation.\n\nII. Arrival\n\nIn the inaugural March issue of UFO Magazine India, columnist Ramkrishan Vaishnav deconstructs the Drake equation proposed by American astrophysicist Frank Drake, a mathematical formula used to estimate the number of detectable extraterrestrials (ETs) in the Milky Way.\n\n“I’m a UFOlogist because I’m a scientist. Even the Indian military has reported sightings,” says the 27-year-old entrepreneur from Nagaur, Rajasthan. “We know little about what lies beyond our own solar system. Why dismiss possibilities altogether?”\n\nIn his teens (and with The X-Files etched in his psyche), Vaishnav signed up to help create 3D maps for NASA’s moon missions, analyse asteroid samples for The Planetary Society, and study radio data for the SETI@Home project, the UC Berkeley offshoot of SETI or Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute.\n\nBut his turning point was March 2008. Just two months after he’d set up TOP (The Other Planet) Research Group to investigate UFO sightings, Vaishnav heard of a sighting in Banswara village, where eight locals reported seeing an unfamiliar craft in the afternoon sky.\n\nSix days later, Vaishnav was there. “The villagers described the UFO as a hat-shaped object with a bright underlight. We also found an odd-shaped stone that looked like nothing else in the radius we scanned. Image evidence of this encounter is the best you’ll find in India,” he says.\n\nWhat’s really in the sky over your head? Take a look at some of the informed opinions\n\nVaishnav is now founder of ExpeTechnologies and Shakti Innovative Products. He has filed four patents: for a solar satellite plant, non-conventional wireless mobile charging, touchscreen technology, and a next-gen user-interface system.\n\nTech research is his bread and butter, but ufology remains his Danish pastry.\n\n“I’m intrigued by why many sightings are from Rajasthan and West Bengal. And the Kongka Pass in Ladakh,” he muses. “It’s also a remote military base, so you never know.\n\nIII. Signs\n\nOn October 26, 2014, at 4.55 am, a man looks out of the window in Thane and sees a horizontal row of red, yellow and green lights that blink but remain stationary for several minutes, then disappear. He records footage on his cellphone.\n\nOn November 7, 2014, a fast-moving object is captured hovering over Bengaluru, framed against a full moon. It stays there for nearly an hour, then disappears as suddenly as it appeared.\n\nThese cases are among 60 sightings in 2014 that were assigned to Kumaresan Ramanathan after he joined Mutual UFO Network (MUFON).\n\nRamanathan is a senior technical engineer with a Chennai-based IT firm who blogs as alienseeker on Wordpress. In 2012, he became India’s first ‘certified UFO investigator’ under MUFON, the largest non-profit investigating UFOs, with 3,000 members worldwide.\n\nPushkar Vaidya is an astrobiologist and founder of the Indian Astrobiology Research Centre in Mumbai, which studies the origin, forms and future of life in the universe.\n\n“As they say in The X-Files: ‘I wanted to believe, but the tools have been taken away’.” —Pushkar Vaidya\n\n“MUFON employs scientific methods, not conjecture,” says the 36-year-old. “You have to renew your membership and purchase manuals every year, then take an exam and score at least 80% to become a qualified investigator.”\n\nThe test is a mix of objective and multiple choice questions, spanning subjects such as how to interact with eyewitnesses and the plan of action if a witness claims to have an encounter. “They present hypothetical situations to gauge if you’d make for a good investigator,” Ramanathan explains. “All tests are examined at the MUFON headquarters in Newport Beach, California. If you make the cut, you’re given an ID and certificate proclaiming you’re licensed.”\n\nBut it’s not all love and sunshine. “Of every 100 cases, about 97 end up being fake — optical illusions, doctored images, or everyday objects mistakenly identified as otherwise,” he admits. “This teaches you discernment.”\n\nNow an independent ufologist after working with MUFON for two years, Ramanathan will visit Aniketty, near Coimbatore, to study a spurt of unexplained objects reported since 2011.\n\n“My family always supported me,” he replies, when asked what people make of his ‘other job’. “Some collegians called me Jaadu for devoting so much time to ufology. But who cares about acquaintances?”\n\nSlideshow: Take a look at some of India’s most iconic UFO sightings?\n\nIV. The Fifth Element\n\nAt 8.28 p.m. on December 15, 1987, six-year-old Kamal Pant stood on the terrace of his Dehradun home and observed a large, red light soaring directly overhead.\n\n“No, it wasn’t a plane, helicopter, or prank,” he says, before you’ve asked the question. “Whatever it was stayed there a while and made no sound.”\n\nThe incident would spur the self-professed ‘sky watcher’ and fan of Star Trek, The X-Files, mythology, and conspiracy theories to scour the internet for all things UFO and ET. Then in 2014, he photographed and filmed what he claims is “a mothership taking off from and landing on the moon.” From thereon, Pant goes full steam ahead.\n\n“I even mailed NASA about it, but didn’t hear from them. Until a month later, when I got an email from someone in Houston asking me to ‘stay away’,” he claims.\n\n“Do you have this email, or a snapshot of it?”\n\n“No. My system got corrupt a day later, and some of my videos vanished. My computer had been tampered with.”\n\nIT engineer Kumaresan Ramanathan says some of his colleagues called him Jaadu, after the alien in the Hindi film Koi... Mil Gaya, but he doesn’t care.\n\nOn the job with a UFO investigator The first thing to do when you receive a report about a UFO sighting is rule out what’s explainable, says Kumaresan Ramanathan, who has served as chief investigator with MUFON (India).\n\n“Phenomena like strange lights are more explainable than not. These can be caused by anything from crackers to iridium flares caused by moving satellites.”\n\nOnline tools like FlightRadar and Heavens-Above can help determine if there was a passing craft or astronomical occurrence in the area at the time of the sighting.\n\nInterviews with eyewitnesses are generally conducted via email or over the phone. “Only sightings that are compelling require us to go on site,” Ramanathan says.\n\nWhat tools does a UFO investigator use? Hitesh Yadav, who is self-trained, lists a film camera, compass, telescope, tape recorder, electromagnetic field or EMF sensor, Geiger counter (for radiation), scintillation counter (for ionising radiation), and Plaster of Paris to make moulds in case impressions are found!\n\nPant, a computer science lecturer at a private university in Dehradun, is what naysayers would call a tinfoil hatter (conspiracy theorist). He believes NASA and the US are involved in a cover-up, and that alien technology was obtained from the Roswell crash. He also claims to have CE-5 communication with ETs – that is, telepathic communication between himself and aliens.\n\n“My mother and wife have seen everything and know I’m not lying,” Pant says. “Distant relatives call me sanki (madcap), but it doesn’t affect me.”\n\nThe 36-year-old father of a toddler, who works with both Disclosure and TOP Research Group, is currently looking into sightings in Ranichauri village, Tehri-Garhwal district. “The events are so common, locals call the beings pariyaan (fairies). They also tell their children not to step out after dark lest they be taken away.”\n\nHis colleagues at the university, Pant says, have no qualms with his interests and theories. And even if they did, he wouldn’t break into a sweat.\n\n“Every time I look at the sky, I feel like something, and someone, wants to communicate with me,” he shares. “No one can take that away from me.”\n\nV. 2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nPushkar Vaidya likes his coffee cold and his feuds hot.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2015, the astrobiologist was embroiled in a scientific tug of war with astrophysicist and author Jayant Narlikar. The bone of contention: Narlikar’s hypotheses supporting panspermia – the theory that life exists throughout the universe and is distributed through asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. In short: life on earth may have come from external sources.\n\nA truce was eventually called when Vaidya founded the Indian Astrobiology Research Centre (IARC) in Mumbai, for which Narlikar now serves as mentor.\n\n“I’m open to the possibility of ET microbial or intelligent life. I just didn’t think there was enough evidence,” says Vaidya. “If anything, panspermia research is one of IARC’s focus areas.”\n\n‘Every time I look at the sky, I feel like something, and someone, wants to communicate with me. No one can take that away from me,’ says Dehradun-based computer science lecturer Kamal Pant, 36.\n\nVaidya is no ufologist. The 36-year-old straddles the no-man’s land between belief and scepticism. His bond with Arthur C. Clarke, one of the world’s most prolific sci-fi authors, has much to do with it.\n\n“When I was 16 and studying in Sri Lanka, I wrote In Search of Aliens. Arthur Clarke lived in Colombo and as an ardent fan, I went to his home because I wanted him to pen the foreword to my book,” he laughs. “He didn’t write it, but that kicked off a two-year association.”\n\nVaidya credits Clarke for bringing wonderment and adventure to science. “Science is now increasingly taking on a tone of finality, especially when it comes to the search for alien life,” he feels.\n\nBut he also throws the gauntlet to ufologists.\n\n“The UFO phenomenon is real from a research perspective. The problem is how people go about it. If you look at everything as alien, you’re better calling yourself a flying saucer investigator,” he reasons.\n\nA long discussion touches upon everything from cattle mutilations to the Kardashev Scale, which hypothesises that the most intelligent civilisations can harness energies on a galactic – even cosmic – scale to partake in astral travel.\n\nThere’s a lot Pushkar Vaidya believes in. What he’s waiting for is substantiation.\n\n“As they say in The X-Files: ‘I wanted to believe, but the tools have been taken away’,” he smiles.\n\n.\n\nWant to review the evidence?

(437, 'SC alcohol ban: After clearance, Cyber Hub returns to party mode... in a cagey way', 'Group selfies, couples walking hand in hand, high fives and hugs being exchanged was the sight as Gurgaonites (we refuse to say Gurugramites!) flocked to Cyber Hub in their party togs on Friday night.\n\nThis was the start of the first weekend after 33 bars and restaurants in Cyber Hub got the licence to start serving alcohol again, following the clearance obtained from the Haryana excise department on Thursday. Cyber Hub is close to National Highway 8 and these establishments had been hit by the Supreme Court ban on the sale of liquor within 500 metres of state and national highways, with effect from April 1. The aim was to reduce the number of accidents caused by driving under the influence of alcohol. Following a re-measurement of distance, the restaurants at Sector 29, in Gurgaon, had got clearance a few days earlier. With Cyber Hub also cleared, party nights are back in full swing.\n\nHowever, while the revellers were happy on Friday, delighted to be back in their favourite watering holes, we found a curious cageyness on the part of the establishments. At most places, the establishment staff refused to speak and they interfered when we tried photographing the party crowds. A couple of guards began tailing us and then demanded that our recorded conversations (with party-goers) be deleted. Even photographs taken with camera phones appeared to arouse suspicion. A public relations executive representing Cyber Hub said that the rules for communicating with the media had changed quite a lot now.\n\nTo sum it up, the atmosphere was highly guarded.\n\nAll of that didn’t deter the revellers. They were in party mode and were grooving to Bollywood hits. Getting high was on their mind. “Yeah, that’s the plan,” said quite a few of the party people, just before they hit the dance floor. “It feels good to be back,” said Mohit Gaur from Gurgaon, adding, “I had stopped partying since the liquor ban came into effect. I didn’t support the decision, as people who wanted to have booze, were doing so regardless [of the ban]. There should be stringent checks on drunken driving.”\n\nMisty, a Cyber Hub regular, said, “At first, I rejected my friend’s offer to come to Gurgaon. But after she told me that the liquor ban has been lifted, I was totally up for it and said, ‘I’ll see you in half hour.’” (laughs)\n\nSome of the party-goers at the Cyber Hub in Gurgaon. (Naina Arora/HT Photo)\n\n“Cyber Hub allows us to work hard and party harder. It’s really happening tonight. The past few weeks have been really boring.

(440, 'Blood, crime and gore: The invisible world of India’s police photographers', 'On a dark street near a textile mill in the Bombay of the ’80s, two men were loitering with intent. One was a poor mill-hand waiting for his jobber to pay him his month’s wages. The other man, a little more desperate, was waiting near the gate to jump on him. There was a scuffle; a shirt was torn, a purse snatched, a dagger flashed, and a man dead on the asphalt. The cops when called, sought out eye-witnesses and took their notes, as they waited for their colleague, the photographer. Amol Athnikar, reaching the spot, lifted his boxy camera, the H 16 Reflex, and trained it towards the surrounding scene and then the ground where the blood was drying, to expose in a photograph what would rather stay hidden.\n\nCities are linear by design. And people seem sorted only in appearance. In some shadowy corner, someone is biting their nails, someone needs help, someone is being pushed over the edge this very minute. “You never know who is going to pull a trigger, who is going to snap under what pressure,” says Athnikar, who retired in 2016 having joined the Mumbai police in the ’80s.\n\nA quiet pride carried this man of stocky build and searching eyes through that intense decade. “In those days the officer had to wait for the photographer to arrive. Now with the smartphone everyone has a camera in his pocket,” he says with a shrug. Athnikar shot the momentous Bombay textile mills strike, and the city police’s final war on the mob. In the riots following the Babri Masjid demolition [1992-93], he shot 80 corpses a day. It took a toll, he says. The pain in those photographs created a commotion in his head. His senior, Dattaram Kathe, another police photographer, who taught him the ropes, ‘shot’ Manya Surve, the graduate-turned-gangster (played by John Abraham in a Bollywood film) who made his first foray into crime by planning a bank heist following the plot of a James Hadley Chase novel he had read in jail. Surve died in a police encounter. Kathe shot the crime scene. In this incident what was the crime and who were the criminals Athnikar would rather not say. It was not done on his beat, after all.\n\n“Faltu dimak nahi laganey ka,” (Not going to work my brain over nothing) he says. But there is always an official reality and a photographer, the supporting staff of the police, has to be at hand, to provide evidence as proof.\n\nPhoto as Evidence\n\n“Under Section 45 of the Indian Evidence Act, the Photograph is a Document and a Photographer is an ‘Expert’ just as much as a shoemaker is also an expert if he made the shoe found at the scene of crime,” explains veteran investigator VM Pandit, formerly with the Central Bureau of Investigation. “Because he has shot the crime scene he is called in as witness.” A police photographer, after his photograph has been presented in court as evidence of crime, rarely changes the narrative. There is only one side he can take and only one story he can repeat – the police’s.\n\nDelhi police photographer Sanjeev Kumar Singh capturing the door through which a burglar has broken in. (Raj K Raj/HT Photo)\n\nAmarpal Palwe, a senior police photographer with the Mumbai police, displaying an old black and white cameras used by the police in the ’80s. (Paramita Ghosh / HT Photo)\n\n“Suppose a murder has happened, but its case comes up after three years,” says a photographer. “By then, I have shot 300 more corpses, stood before different storeyed buildings, wooden doors, grilled doors, broken windows, exit and entry points of hundreds of houses. So I will repeat whatever the officer briefs me before the court proceedings, won’t I?”\n\nYes and no. It takes a good judge to pick holes in a police theory. And it also takes a photographer. A police photograph can also inadvertently weaken the prosecution’s case.“In Punjab, many militant deaths were proven to be cases of fake encounters. The police said they had been ambushed but had it been so, it would have been natural to crouch on the ground and fire back. The bullet can hit the militant’s stomach or head. But why were the photos of bullet marks found towards the top of a tree? Because there had been no ambush at all, people were taken randomly to forest areas and fired on,’ says Pandit.\n\nIn 2003, Amitabh Singh of the Lucknow police shot a picture that killed attempts to prove that the murder of Madhumita, a woman in relationship with minister Amarmani Tripathi, was due to a house break-in. “I had shot her body at close range. The stomach was at least six inches up from her navel…. The post-mortem showed that she was four months pregnant,” says Singh. The photos eventually led to a probe that linked Tripathi with the murder as Madhumita was carrying his child. Singh has shot 1,50,000 corpses till date. Madhumita is one of them.\n\nSingh has also “not taken leave for 25 years.” His marriage survives because Mrs Singh had been prepped before marriage that any plans for vacation would be nipped in the bud. Had he, for any reason, stayed home on the day of the murder, May 9, 2003, Tripathi may not have been serving a life sentence.\n\n“The dead should at least get justice,” says the photographer.\n\nVM Pandit, veteran investigator formerly with the CBI at his office in Delhi (Raj K Raj/HT PHOTO)\n\nPolice and the public\n\nIf law is the codification of acceptable behaviour, crime is its opposite. “Crime is abnormal, but criminals are normal people. And anyone can turn to crime,” says Sanket Rathod, a young Mumbai policeman who accompanies us the day a theft has been reported from a juice shop in Bhendi Bazaar. The traffic moves slowly. The area is clotted with cars, scooters and cycles. Horns are honked as if honking is going out of fashion. “You are not to ask any questions,” Rathod cautions as we enter the juice-shop. It might make the shopkeeper ask him about the progress in investigations he is not in a position to reveal. Rathod captures the crime scene in four shots. He takes a photo of the finger prints that have been detected on the shop’s safe-box. Job done, he leaves.\n\nHow is Mumbai doing as a city? Which crimes are more, or less? “Murders are down…. Just housebreaking every two to three days…. Nine lakh was stolen from [photographer] Atul Kasbekar’s house this March. The case was solved, it was an insider’s job. Mumbai otherwise,” he says sincerely, “is a very peaceful city.” A police photographer is not just Ceasar’s wife who has to be above suspicion. There is a fair deal of watching one’s tongue, but once in a while it can run away.\n\nPolice photographers also wear no peaked cap, or uniform. A certain facelessness goes with the territory. “We go on call usually with the fingerprint expert and return to the police station and just file our photos,” says Sanjeev Kumar of the Delhi police.\n\n“We are not executives,” says Amarpal Palwe, a senior police photographer with the Mumbai police at our meeting. “We have no uniform, we are the support staff.” Rathod and he belong to the same police station. Unlike Palwe, who joined as a photographer, Rathod was first a constable. On becoming an assistant police photographer, he deposited his uniform at the police headquarters.A police photographer, of course, has more pressing matters to see to than rue the loss of a uniform.\n\nVijay Raj, a police photographer with Meerut Police working on his pictures on the computer.

According to Vijay Raj Singh of the Meerut police, student leader Atul Pradhan has made his mark as a local menace over the past five years. His face has been mostly caught by Singh’s camera when the former was either acting tough, sloganeering at the university gate, or storming the police station. Singh even tried to wear a beard – pointy and French – to escape Pradhan’s eye and avoid obstacles to his work.\n\nPolice photography, says special superintendent of police, J Ravinder Goud, also helps to “warn and train police officials.”\n\nVijay Singh says it is also part of his job to know on which streets to take out his camera.\n\n“Vijay is a good name for a cop,” one ventures to say with Amitabh Bachchan very much on mind.\n\n“Yes to which Raaz (mystery) has been added,” he quips punning on his middle name Raj.\n\n(L-R) Brothers Rajesh, Anil and Sanjay Chaddha who run the Indian Art Studio, an establishment from the pre-Independence era in Mumbai run by its the fourth generation.

Otherwise, the Vega Jane series by David Baldacci, known better for his bestselling crime and intrigue thrillers, would’ve appeared quite original, despite the publishing industry’s avalanche of fantasy adventures targeting a certain age group.\n\nAs things stand, it’s kinda hard to ignore the shadow of JK Rowling when we read about three young people — two women with magical powers and one young man with no such gift — fighting a bunch of evil fellows who can fly and throw spells and get summoned by another chap who’s several degrees more evil than the rest.\n\nThe book cover.\n\nOnce we get past these comparisons, the book, which is the third in the series, moves at a fast clip. The opening line — “We landed, invisible, on the cobbles, and were nearly killed” — is enough to warm up the reader’s interest at the speed of the latest microwave oven. Baldacci doesn’t seem to have a great talent for building context with a light touch, so if you haven’t read the first two books, you’d struggle a little to figure out what the fuss is about. Trundling, the story tells us that these three escaped a nasty place called Quag, where trying to stay alive is everyone’s main job, and that Vega is from Wormwood, where folks know toast and bacon but say ‘wugs’ and ‘slivers’ when they mean ‘people’ and ‘minutes’.\n\nAt the centre of everything is, of course, Vega’s bravery. She’s an engaging heroine, despite a tedious flaring up of jealousy about her maybe-friend Petra, who’s crazy about Delph, the man in the group. Not much time is wasted in letting the reader know that all three would be required to sacrifice themselves.

(444, 'Does baby powder cause ovarian cancer? Here are the claims and counterclaims', 'Johnson & Johnson has been hit with a multimillion-dollar jury verdict for the fourth time over whether the talc in its iconic baby powder causes ovarian cancer when applied regularly for feminine hygiene. Late Thursday, a St. Louis jury awarded $110.5 million to Lois Slemp, 62, of Wise, Virginia, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012. She blames her illness on her use of the company’s talcum powder-containing products for more than 40 years.\n\nBesides Slemp’s case, three other jury trials in St. Louis reached similar outcomes last year, awarding the plaintiffs $72 million, $70.1 million and $55 million, for a combined total of $307.6 million. The company says its product is safe, and it plans to appeal the latest verdict, as it has the other three.\n\nJohnson & Johnson also has had some legal victories, including in March when a St. Louis jury rejected the claims of a Tennessee woman with ovarian and uterine cancer. Also, two cases in New Jersey were thrown out by a judge who said the plaintiffs’ lawyers hadn’t presented reliable evidence that talc leads to ovarian cancer. The next baby powder trial is in June in St. Louis, and will be followed by another in July in California.\n\nThe biggest studies have found no link between talcum powder applied to the genitals and ovarian cancer. But about two dozen smaller studies over three decades have mostly found a modest connection — a 20% to 40% increased risk among talc users. (Shutterstock)\n\nWhat do investors think?\n\nInvestors don’t seem worried that J&J is in financial trouble, even though the company faces an estimated 2,000 similar lawsuits. J&J shares fell 62 cents to $123.10 in late-afternoon trading Friday.\n\nJohnson & Johnson, the world’s biggest maker of health care products, brings in about $72 billion a year selling prescription drugs, medical devices, diagnostic equipment and consumer products ranging from baby shampoo and Aveeno skin care items to Tylenol pain reliever and Band-Aids.\n\nBecause of its size and diversified product lines, J&J is sued frequently and investors don’t panic when it loses product liability lawsuits, so its stock price rarely drops much after losses. Also, the company clearly intends to keep fighting lawsuits alleging its iconic baby powder isn’t safe, rather than settling suits at this point.\n\nWhat is a talc?\n\nTalc is a mineral that is mined from deposits around the world, including the US. The softest of minerals, it’s crushed into a white powder. It’s been widely used in cosmetics and other personal care products to absorb moisture since at least 1894, when Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Powder was launched. But it’s mainly used in a variety of other products, including paint and plastics.\n\nDoes it cause ovarian cancer?\n\nLike many questions in science, there’s no definitive answer. Finding the cause of cancer is difficult. It would be unethical to do the best kind of study, asking a group of women to use talcum powder on their genitals and wait to see if it causes cancer, while comparing them to a group who didn’t use it. While ovarian cancer is often fatal, it’s relatively rare. It accounts for only about 22,400 of the 1.7 million new cases of cancer expected to be diagnosed in the United States this year.Factors that are known to increase a women’s risk of ovarian cancer include age, obesity, use of estrogen therapy after menopause, not having any children, certain genetic mutations and personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer.\n\nWhat research shows\n\nThe biggest studies have found no link between talcum powder applied to the genitals and ovarian cancer. But about two dozen smaller studies over three decades have mostly found a modest connection — a 20% to 40% increased risk among talc users. However, that doesn’t mean talc causes cancer. Several factors make that unlikely, and there’s no proof talc, which doesn’t interact with chemicals or cells, can travel up the reproductive tract, enter the ovaries and then trigger cancer. One large study published in June 2016 that followed 51,000 sisters of breast cancer patients found genital talc users had a reduced risk of ovarian cancer, 27% lower than in non-users. An analysis of two huge, long-running US studies, the Women’s Health Initiative and the Nurses’ Health Study, showed no increased risk of ovarian cancer in talc users.\n\nWatch: Talcum powder link to ovarian cancer explained\n\nWhat experts say\n\nIf there were a true link, Dr Hal C. Lawrence III says large studies that tracked women’s health for years would have verified results of the smaller ones. “Lord knows, with the amount of powder that’s been applied to babies’ bottoms, we would’ve seen something,” if talc caused cancer, said Lawrence, vice president of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute’s Dr Nicolas Wentzensen says the federal agency’s position is that there’s not a clear connection. “It is very hard to establish causal relationships,” he said, adding, “A lot of ovarian cancers occur in women who have never used talc, and many women have used talc and not gotten ovarian cancer.” Research director Elizabeth Ward of the American Cancer Society says it is unusual to have so much discrepancy between studies. “The risk for any individual woman, if there is one, is probably very small,” Ward said.\n\nFollow @htlifeandstyle for more', '2017-05-08 18:23:05', 'i445.jpg', 5, -1.65, 'The biggest studies have found no link between talcum powder applied to the genitals and ovarian cancer.What research shows\n\nThe biggest studies have found no link between talcum powder applied to the genitals and ovarian cancer.But about two dozen smaller studies over three decades have mostly found a modest connection — a 20% to 40% increased risk among talc users.But about two dozen smaller studies over three decades have mostly found a modest connection — a 20% to 40% increased risk among talc users.“It is very hard to establish causal relationships,” he said, adding, “A lot of ovarian cancers occur in women who have never used talc, and many women have used talc and not gotten ovarian cancer.” Research director Elizabeth Ward of the American Cancer Society says it is unusual to have so much discrepancy between studies.', 3, 24, 61, 8, 1),

Following surgery, all the patients had been treated with chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy. Patients were followed for an average of 20 months.\n\nThe researchers divided the patients up into four groups according the dose of radiation they received. The results suggest that the higher the dose, the longer the patient lived. Radiation dose is measured in units called grays, with one gray (Gy) equivalent to absorbing one joule of radiation energy per kilogram of body tissue. Patients who received a dose less than 45 Gy had an average survival of 13 months, patients with a dose in the range of 45 to less than 50 Gy had an average survival of 21 months.\n\nThe survival rates for pancreatic cancer remain stubbornly low, with most patients given months rather than years to live. (Shutterstock)\n\nFor the next group with a dose range of 50 to less than 55 Gy, average survival was 22 months and for the group with the highest doses of 55 Gy or more, average survival was 28 months.\n\nThe research was presented by Francesco Cellini, radiation oncologist at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli and the Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.\n\nHe told the conference that the survival rates for pancreatic cancer remain stubbornly low, with most patients given months rather than years to live. “We have found that the higher the dose, the longer the patient is likely to survive. This may indicate that the doses were simply not high enough in previous research,” Cellini said.\n\nHe further noted that the pattern of increasing survival in this study suggested that tumours of the pancreas are not resistant to radiation; they just need to be tackled with an adequate dose.\n\nCellini continued that this study suggests radiotherapy should be considered for patients with early stage pancreatic cancer. “It may also be worthwhile to investigate whether current radiotherapy techniques could also bring survival benefits to patients with more advanced tumours.”\n\nFollow @htlifeandstyle for more.', '2017-05-08 18:23:21', 'i446.jpg', 5, 0.5, 'He told the conference that the survival rates for pancreatic cancer remain stubbornly low, with most patients given months rather than years to live.The survival rates for pancreatic cancer remain stubbornly low, with most patients given months rather than years to live.The results suggest that the higher the dose, the longer the patient lived.“We have found that the higher the dose, the longer the patient is likely to survive.Patients who received a dose less than 45 Gy had an average survival of 13 months, patients with a dose in the range of 45 to less than 50 Gy had an average survival of 21 months.', 3, 24, 61, 8, 1),

(447, 'In defence of the Burkini: how to make conservative swimwear sexy!', 'Last year, we decided to take a family vacation to Bali, a place I had daydreamed about since reading the book Eat, Pray, Love with a sort of silent pining for the writerly life of Elizabeth Gilbert.\n\nIn my pre-vacation excitement, I Googled all about Bali, while also reaching out to friends for help. Much to my dismay, the girlfriends responded with how I must flaunt a ‘sexy bikini’. Before I left, a bunch of middle-aged ladies in my posh South Delhi parlour talked about getting a bikini wax; according to them, this is imperative on beach vacays.\n\n“I don’t have the body for a bikini. Besides, aren’t bikini waxes blindingly painful? And what’s this pressure to conform?” I snapped.\n\nA woman getting a pedicure leaned in, saying, “I went to Bali for my 50th. All my life, my husband forbade me from wearing a bikini. So I used to preserve cutouts from magazines, drooling over heroines in swimwear, including Sharmila Tagore. She was a real bomb. Bong, like you!”\n\nI shrugged.\n\n“My son Monty grew up hearing my mother-in-law and hubby telling me to cover up. So though his girlfriends, school and college mates indulged in pool parties, there was always a different set of rules for a daughter, wife and parent,” she adds.\n\n“I too grew conscious, put on weight and preferred swimming in tights and tees. But things changed when I turned 50. Our kitty decided on a Bali trip, and there we were. Twenty women in designer bikinis…some with transparent palazzo pants, some worn under chiffon capes or with long kaftans. It was a revolution. Bali set us free, beta.”\n\n“How? You were still covering up…still cowering to misogyny.” I cut her short.\n\nThe woman met my eyes. “Have you ever felt covering up is more liberating than baring it all? At 50, we were finally comfortable with our bodies. We shunned male control, but at the same time, we wanted to look and feel our best. I wasn’t hiding under my robe; my bikini was as sexy as anyone else’s. I showed what I wished to. The bikini is about balance…a deep, inner harmony.”\n\nA kaftan serves the purpose of a naked dress and will highlight certain areas of your body. On Devanshi: Swimwear kaftan, Amante; Shoes, Zara (Irina Usova)\n\nCover girls\n\nOur models are real women, who sizzled in style in conservative swimwear\n\nAs I listened, I thought about the noise made by mayors across 30 French coastal resorts that banned burkinis in 2016. (Burkinis cover the head, torso and limbs like a wetsuit with a hood.) The mayors refused to lift the restrictions, despite the country’s highest administrative court ruling that the bans were a “serious and manifestly illegal violation of fundamental freedoms.”\n\nIn the same year, sports goods retail chain, Decathlon, recorded a 70 per cent spike in sale of women’s swimwear after it introduced leg suits, tights and full-sleeved leg suits. Indian women who splashed about in suits with skirt-fronts or T-shirts with tights, were at ease in maillots: sleeveless one-piece swimsuits with high-cut legs.\n\nWas their slow graduation to the bikini a reason to flaunt their well-worked-out bodies? Or was the average Indian woman now customising the bikini to reflect her growing sense of identity – setting free from a cage that labelled any skin show as vulgar and slutty?\n\nDesigner Anupama Dayal, a leading name in the resortwear market, speaks of a gradual mindset transformation. “The indoctrination runs deep here, most women want to maintain the ‘good girl’ image,” she says. “When I was married, I too wore the one piece, seeking my husband’s approval. But when I was a divorced 40-year-old travelling to Turkey, I invested in a bikini for the first time. Today, I embrace the sea on my own terms.”\n\n“Even my Australian buyers claim women seek designs where the arms don’t show, so we team a bikini with a cape/robe. ”\n\nA one-piece swimwear comprises tank top and shorts. Wear it if you like the athletic look minus the frills. (Left) On Devanshi: Tank top with matching swim shorts, Kunchals; Shoes, Zara.

(Right) On Marija: Two-piece swimwear, Amante (Irina Usova)\n\nShow and tell\n\nUndoubtedly the Indian swimwear market is becoming part of a more vibrant fashion industry, with consumers demanding fit, comfort and value for money, along with more stylish, sexy cuts.\n\nNarresh Kukreja of the designer swimwear/resortwear label Shivan & Narresh says, “The top trend was the one shoulder maillot. It was elegant, provided the right support, and was not too sporty, just right for women across the broad 25-55 years category. In the case of the two-piece, the high-waisted 1960-70 bathing suit is still going strong, as it covers optimally, while showing a little midriff.”\n\nNarresh says different cities exude different sensibilities. Delhi women are conservative about cleavage, cut-outs and bare legs, and less reserved about their bare backs, unlike Mumbai women or those in Chennai, who aren’t afraid of flaunting their curves. Women in Kolkata, known for their sensuality, are comfortable with front and back show, and since they travel abroad frequently the consumption of swimwear there is supposedly soaring.\n\nA swimsuit can be worn with a sarong if you’re bottom-heavy but are not afraid to flaunt your curves and arms. On Marija: Swimwear with sarong, Kunchals; Sunglasses, Vogue Eyewear. (Irina Usova)\n\nNarresh blames the standardised American and European sizes, that were earlier available, for taking a toll on the Indian woman’s self-confidence. He also points out how we as a culture have slowly steered away from size-zero worship, with women idol-worshipping Rihanna and Beyoncé, in a generation that thrives on selfies and an innate narcissism.\n\n“Swimwear and lingerie constitute the most shoppable category, and let’s not forget the ? 800-crore wedding industry – where swimwear belongs to the honeymoon trousseau,” he adds.\n\nI think of the lady in the beauty parlour and compare her to one of my readers, a 30-year-old, single Muslim woman in Pune, who recently shared a Facebook post on how easy access to modest swimwear on e-commerce sites helped her take up swimming. Sehr, a PR professional, wears knee-length tights and a maillot, taking a dip in the pool minus the awkward stares.\n\nA one-piece swimwear with matching skirt is a good outfit idea if you’re at a pool party and want to dance around freely, and just have fun.

I can swim freely as I’m not obsessed with the thought of how I look. There’s nothing not feminist or non-secular about choosing the burkini,” she says.\n\nAs an Indian woman who nurses something of a complex for growing up as a fat child, I ask myself if the acceptance of the bikini is a result of our liberation or our aspirations to fit in?\n\nWhether it stands for change or continuity? Whether I should’ve just got one in Bali and combined it with a kaftan?\n\nI ask myself if the bikini isn’t a straightforward symbol of feminine perfection.\n\nI ask myself if the bikini is a rebellion.

(448, 'Now... it’s all about loving the children: Karan Johar’s first interview after becoming a father', 'To get Karan Johar to bare his soul, you must have coffee with him. I do that on Good Friday afternoon, at his Dharma Productions office in suburban Mumbai. But the man sitting opposite me, dreamily sipping a tall, cold Caffe Frappuccino, is not Sunday night’s stylishly-attired hotshot impresario of India’s most watched celebrity chat show. Karan looks zoned out. And sleep deprived.\n\nHe was on “paternity leave”. And he hadn’t stepped into the office since March 28. His twin babies Roohi and Yash Johar, born two-and-half months prematurely on February 7, were discharged from hospital on March 29. And overnight the ‘Unsuitable Boy’ turned into ‘Superstar Dad’. The babies had taken over his life. They are now his world. I don’t think Karan, otherwise a notorious workhorse of a filmmaker and arguably Bollywood’s most inveterate party animal, has been out much in the last 18 days. Or thought about work. He quite simply has his hands full at home.\n\nThis is unprecedented for Bollywood’s most celebrated producer and director. The staff at Dharma, and his mother Hiroo Johar, used as they are to Karan’s “non-stop mad energy” (as Shah Rukh Khan put it), are amazed at the change. But he’s in office today because a high-powered team from Amazon Studios is knocking on Bollywood’s doors. With that out of the way, Karan sat down for the mother of all chats with me – yes, pun intended.\n\nI don’t know what he offers his guests on Koffee with Karan, given that he sips Diet Coke himself out of a coffee cup. I have regular machine-made coffee from Dharma’s pantry. I’ve been warned that the honest and outspoken Karan doesn’t want to talk about fatherhood. He’s just 66 days into the role. But Bollywood’s newest and most extraordinary single parent enthusiastically has answers even for the questions I don’t ask. He is a doting father and a fussy mother. He only interrupts our conversation five times to take calls from the twins’ paediatrician. So I sit back and enjoy my coffee while the proud papa does all the talking...\n\n‘This is my biggest blockbuster’\n\nFor Karan Johar, now it is all about loving the children. (Sayan Mukherjee)\n\n“My life has changed since Roohi and Yash arrived. At 44, this is my biggest blockbuster. I still haven’t realised the enormity of what’s happened. They’re only two months old. And all they do is eat, sleep, burp, wail and poop. Kabhi khushi, kabhie gham! While I stare at them in wonder. But I can’t get over the fact that they are mine. It’s like a powerful switch has suddenly come on in my life, filling the emptiness in my personal space with new energy. I get teary-eyed just looking at them. It’s surreal to think of them as my daughter and son. It’s daunting even, but in a gorgeous way, when I wake up suddenly at night to remember that I have life breathing in the next room that I’m totally accountable for. My universe was Dad, Mom and films. But now there are Roohi and Yash. My two new friends.\n\n“I’m going to bring Roohi and Yash to the office. Why not! Aren’t they productions of Dharma Productions? . I want them to be all over the place.”\n\nWhen they were born, I knew that my work, travel and social commitments would take a backseat because I’d want to give them unconditional love, care and attention. And now that they are home, I cannot stay away from them for long. It’s only been hours since I’ve been away, and look at me! I’m sharply aware of the time, I keep looking at my phone, because it’s the channel to my kids. I’ve decided that as soon as they are old enough, and before they start school, I’m going to bring Roohi and Yash to the office. Why not! Aren’t they productions of Dharma Productions? I want everybody here to know them. I want them to be all over the place. And I’m already looking at building a crèche here. It will be like Disneyland! I’m also looking forward to them travelling with me when I go outstation on shoots. Bebo’s son Taimur is a few months older than Roohi and Yash, and she and I have already started making plans for holidays together!”\n\nAn emotion-packed welcome home\n\n“The day they came home from the hospital is an experience that’s going to stay etched in my memory. Like the premier of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in 1998. It was my first film and I still remember every moment. What I wore. What I said. The day I carried Roohi and Yash home was like that. Life changing. Actually, it was a full on K3G moment! Very dramatic. With my Mom proudly standing at the door like Jaya Aunty holding a puja thali with burning diyas to welcome not her bahu – but her grandkids, all my aunts crowded behind her. I took my babies straight into the room where my father’s picture is placed. When I saw their reflection in the glass, merging with his image, I closed my eyes in gratitude and experienced the awe of the moment. I knew they had his blessings. These are scenes out of a film but drawn from real life. For me, that was a moment of faith. But it was only the trailer. Picture abhi baki hai!\n\n“I took my babies straight into the room where my father’s picture is placed. When I saw their reflection in the glass, merging with his image, I closed my eyes in gratitude and experienced the awe of the moment.”\n\nFatherhood is proving to be a breathtaking rollercoaster ride. When they were conceived, I was ecstatic, but I told myself I would be a responsible father and not a paranoid mother. Then came the complexities of premature birth. And the heartache of seeing them in the incubator. But I felt a strong sense of ownership. They were my lifelines. A lifelong dream come true. And I couldn’t wait to take them in my arms. When I did that for the first time, it was incredible. I knew this was the beginning of a different kind of love story. The start of the best phase of my life. Mothers go through these emotions. Fathers come in later. But I was there right from the start, with the other mothers in the ICU whose babies were also born weighing less than 1.5 kilos, their vital body parts, their tiny lungs and heart underdeveloped. And each time a baby crossed 2 kilos and the nurses put up a smiley sunshine face announcing this, I would celebrate with their mothers because I fully empathised with them.”\n\n‘Who’s to tell me that I can’t be a responsible parent? ’\n\n“I have an entire library of books on baby care. I haven’t read any of them!” (Rohan Shrestha)\n\n“A single father is unusual in India. There are some famous single fathers in the world, celebs who were brave to have babies out of surrogacy, like Cristiano Ronaldo and Ricky Martin. But I wasn’t inspired by them. Or by anybody. I know Tusshar Kapoor took the step first. And what he did was amazing. But by the time his son Laksshya was born, my procedure had also started. I feel connected to Tusshar by our common decision. You can’t be inspired by anybody to have a baby out of surrogacy. You have to be emotionally ready. I was also prepared mentally, physically and logistically.\n\n“I was ready for fatherhood. But was I prepared for twins? I was ready for triplets!”\n\nAt 40, I wasn’t ready. But two years ago, I decided I needed to bring this new energy into my life. I didn’t want to be a victim of my achievements. It’s easy to get carried away by who I am. But I never wanted to be defined by my professional successes. I thought I had lived half my life, and all the things I had done were great, but what about things I hadn’t done? Your achievements are transitional. Emotions are permanent. I had been thinking about having a child for a long time. And I knew I had the capacity to be an adequate parent. I’ve nurtured so many people in the film industry, so many young actors, I’ve been like a parent to them more than a producer and director. I’ve been with them in their professional highs and their emotional meltdowns. But I played devil’s advocate with myself. Was I being selfish? Did I want to have a child only because I was afraid of growing old alone? Would I be an overprotective and overindulgent father because I wouldn’t want my child to accuse me of being a flawed parent and grow up missing a mother? But who’s to tell me that I can’t be a responsible parent, and the best mother and father in the world to my kid? This was an emotional, well-thought-out decision made after acknowledging and addressing all the issues facing me, and after considering all the responsibilities and duties that come with being a single parent. I was ready for fatherhood. But was I prepared for twins? I was ready for triplets!”\n\n‘I introduce every visitor to Roohi and Yash by name .’\n\nKaran feels he could give paranoid mothers a master class. (Sayan Mukherjee)\n\n“Now, of course, my babies are the superstars of my universe. Ever since they came home, I’ve been like a mother, a father and a well-behaved housewife. People have been dropping in non-stop to see them, they come in shifts, and I’ve been running around serving them tea and snacks. Alia Bhatt comes every other day and sits for hours. I’m not paranoid about people wanting to hold my babies. Roohi and Yash are not royalty and meant to be stared at from behind a glass window. But I insist they sanitise their hands and take off their footwear first. Babies absorb energy. I like to think they are making eye contact with everyone but they’re just looking into oblivion. I like to imagine they are smiling in recognition but actually they’re just passing gas! The love and support I’m getting from friends who are family is phenomenal. Everybody feels a sense of responsibility towards me and mine. Even old friends who have reconnected with me after their birth. Everybody says they are now so happy for me. I’m surprised. I didn’t know so many people were unhappy for me earlier! I wish I had known. I was living a life of delusion thinking everything was great. But I would have enjoyed a moment of self-pity.\n\n“People have been dropping in non-stop to see them, they come in shifts, and I’ve been running around serving them tea and snacks. Alia Bhatt comes every other day and sits for hours.”\n\nI introduce every visitor to Roohi and Yash by name. ‘This is your Chacha and this is your Bua!’ I give them all a family tag. I want my babies to know that their family is large. It’s not just Mom and me, though my mother is my biggest support. She’s had multiple surgeries for the spine, for her hips, knees, she’s been in and out of hospital constantly. But you should see her now. Full of zing! She’s up early, fully made up and with her hair done, ready to face a new day with her grandkids. I’ve never seen her looking younger than she is today.\n\nI want all the help I can I get. I have an entire library of books on baby care. I haven’t read any of them! But I listen to all the advice mothers give me. I’m on several WhatsApp baby groups. Everybody has their own gyan. And I’ve received about 3,000 suggestions already. On paediatricians, nurses, how to make the nursery adaptive, what music to play for them – Baby Mozart or Baby Beethoven – dude, when did all this happen? – or simple nursery rhymes, which formula is best – Nan Pro, Similac or Enfamil, how to burp them, monitor their temperatures, when to take them for their immunity shots, what to do if they have nappy rash, what to do when they cry, I listen to everybody and then take my own decisions. I could give paranoid mothers a master class! People ask if I’m a hands-on parent. Do I change my babies’ nappies? I think this is overrated. It doesn’t add up to anything. Changing nappies is not going to go into their energy streams. I don’t remember my parents changing mine. But I remember being held and hugged. Even then, I did it once. The first time Roohi and Yash came home, because I felt it would be great if I was able to clean up their mess. But it was like ticking an inbox! I don’t want to be that kind of hands-on parent when I can be a fulltime heart-on father and mother!”\n\nFrom HT Brunch, May 7, 2017\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/HTBrunch\n\nConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch', '2017-05-08 18:26:05', 'i449.jpg', 5, 2.55, 'But who’s to tell me that I can’t be a responsible parent, and the best mother and father in the world to my kid?I was ready for triplets!”\n\n‘I introduce every visitor to Roohi and Yash by name .’\n\nKaran feels he could give paranoid mothers a master class.When I saw their reflection in the glass, merging with his image, I closed my eyes in gratitude and experienced the awe of the moment.”\n\nFatherhood is proving to be a breathtaking rollercoaster ride.I want them to be all over the place.”\n\nWhen they were born, I knew that my work, travel and social commitments would take a backseat because I’d want to give them unconditional love, care and attention.“People have been dropping in non-stop to see them, they come in shifts, and I’ve been running around serving them tea and snacks.', 3, 24, 61, 8, 1),

As their romance blossoms, their city is ravaged by war – buildings fall prey to bombs, there are retaliatory air strikes, phone signals are lost and internet connectivity suspended.

I also take it personally, as somebody who’s lived a lot of his time in America and Britain. For mongrelized, hybridized people like me, these walls that are coming up between countries are terrible as it makes it impossible to connect the two parts of yourself. Also, after I moved back to Lahore eight years ago, the horrors that have happened in Syria and other places make a part of your mind say ‘what if it happened here?’ I wanted to explore this through a kind of first love – a love between two people who are young and changing very rapidly.\n\nThere’s an interesting depiction of technology in the novel, from drones and surveillance cameras to almost necessary objects like cell phones.\n\nIn many ways, the doors themselves are about technology. We live in a world where technology is making geographical distances disappear. Somebody in Lahore can watch a TV show set in Bombay or Los Angeles, and somebody there can watch footage coming from Lahore or Bombay. In each of our houses, we’re being thrust into other countries and worlds, and the doors are about that. Also technology is shaping who we are as human beings, how we connect, how we fall in love, how we find our way, how we migrate. So both, our dependence on technology and its potential to connect and monitor us are all themes in the book.\n\nYou’ve spoken about globalization being a brutal phenomenon… bringing mass displacement, wars, xenophobia, but also the freedom to reinvent ourselves. Having lived in different countries, how have these global experiences shaped you?\n\nIt’s almost impossible for me to think of who I am, separate from having lived in so many different places. I’m not any one thing. And I write like that, I live in Lahore and I am Pakistani but I cannot claim to represent Pakistan or Pakistanis. And I can’t claim to represent America or Britain. So partly, I’m a foreigner everywhere. Each of us, in our own ways, don’t fit in, whether you’re a liberal person in a conservative family or vice versa or a gay child in a family that’s uncomfortable with homosexuality. Every human being participates in this sense of foreignness, which I think is an essential aspect of being a human being.\n\nExit West offers stark truths about our increasingly fragmented world\n\nWhat led you to move back to Lahore eight years ago? Have you had to creatively restrict your writing because of certain laws?\n\nIt’s hard to generalise about life in South Asia. I live next door to my parents and my children play with their grandparents every day. And that’s how I grew up. I don’t know what it is to be desi or Pakistani but this kind of multi-generation extended family living is much more common here than it is in places like New York or London. To have my children and parents in the same place was the most important reason to move back.\n\nThe interesting thing about restrictions is they don’t necessarily stop creativity. In many instances, they encourage it because you have to be creative to get around them. That’s why sufi poets were writing stuff that could not be expressed in prose four thousand years ago. Reality is a kind of restriction and fiction is a reaction to that. Right now, when I look at India, I think it seems to be making some of the same mistakes that Pakistan has made, which are terrible mistakes. We allowed the oppression of minorities, the rise of a single state-sanctioned ideology, religious chauvinism, oppression of pluralism and victimization of human rights. It’ll probably take Pakistan a generation to get out of the mess we’ve created for ourselves. Seeing this, one would expect India to not want to go down that path. But it is, to a certain extent. Just like Pakistani writers have responded to an oppressive political climate here, Indian writers are responding and will continue to respond to an oppressive political climate in India.\n\nTell us about your relationship with India. When did you last visit?\n\nI have a lot of friends in Delhi and love Bombay. My wife and I often say that if the politics were better, we would spend a lot of time in Bombay because it’s the most cosmopolitan city in South Asia. I’ve been coming to India off and on for 30 years, I came and played soccer here with my school team in the late ’80s and then on book tours. Unusually for me, I haven’t come on a book tour for Exit West and part of the reason for that is the very sad state of the current Indo-Pak relationship. I’m hopeful that in some months, things will be better and I can come there. My wife and I watched The Lunchbox recently and it was wonderful. I’m not a huge Bollywood fan but I’m certainly a fan of Indian writing. Some of my best and closest writing friends are Indians, like Suketu Mehta, who I often stay with when in New York.\n\nYou recently said that your need to write fiction comes from the inability to entirely accept our world as it is. Do I sense a kind of disillusionment?\n\nWell, yes, disillusionment and desire. At some very deep level, I would like there to be a borderless world, where people could move wherever they wanted to move. I think something like that will eventually come to exist. The nation state and its huge role in all of our lives is a temporary political phenomena. It wasn’t there a thousand years ago and it probably won’t be there a thousand years from now. I find borders to be strange, frustrating. Why can’t someone in Delhi hop in a car and visit me in Lahore? Why can’t somebody in Lahore hop on a plane and see their cousin in New York? My desire to imagine a world that’s different certainly informed this novel.\n\nIs there a message you hope readers take away from Exit West?\n\nI hope they have an emotional experience with it, which informs how they think about issues of migration, refugees and change how the world is going to have to adapt to the future. I don’t want them to walk away saying migration is great, we love refugees, get rid of borders. I want them to be less frightened of the future, and although the future will be very different, human life is basically transient. And we can find beauty in transience. We don’t have to have to frightened by it.\n\nWhat fiction does in a political space is it allows readers to have these emotional experiences around particular characters and stories. And this experience is a different encounter with politics than the kind of theoretical encounter you have with an op-ed. I don’t think of Exit West as my manifesto which will galvanise the world. A book by itself does not catalyse a huge change. It’s part of a larger cultural movement, like a wave in the ocean. All of those waves together have the effect of washing up on a particular beach or making a particular cliff crumble. It’s important for all of us to think about these issues in different ways, and this is my part.\n\nFollow @TheCommanist on Twitter\n\nFrom HT Brunch, May 7, 2017\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/HTBrunch\n\nConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch', '2017-05-08 18:27:09', 'i450.jpg', 5, -0.1, 'I hope they have an emotional experience with it, which informs how they think about issues of migration, refugees and change how the world is going to have to adapt to the future.It’s important for all of us to think about these issues in different ways, and this is my part.Also, after I moved back to Lahore eight years ago, the horrors that have happened in Syria and other places make a part of your mind say ‘what if it happened here?’ I wanted to explore this through a kind of first love – a love between two people who are young and changing very rapidly.I don’t know what it is to be desi or Pakistani but this kind of multi-generation extended family living is much more common here than it is in places like New York or London.My wife and I often say that if the politics were better, we would spend a lot of time in Bombay because it’s the most cosmopolitan city in South Asia.', 3, 24, 61, 8, 1),

(451, 'We trust people who share our rituals, be it greetings or the coffee we like: Study', 'From our greetings to our celebrations to how we take our coffee, everyday life is full of shared rituals. These rituals not only help us bond with others, but also push us away from those who don’t share the same practices, according to a recent study.\n\nFindings from a series of experiments suggest that people trust others who did not engage in the same ritual less than those who did.\n\n“The take-home message is that even minimal rituals can lead to bias against people from other groups,” explained lead author Nicholas Hobson of the University of Toronto.\n\nHobson added that they found that a person who engages in an ad-hoc ritual over the course of a week will entrust more of their own money to a group member who went through the same ritual experience, and also entrust less money to someone who had a slightly different ritual experience.\n\nResearch suggests rituals may involve early, automatic processes associated with monitoring others’ behaviour. (Shutterstock)\n\nIn their first experiment, 100 college student participants first estimated the number of dots contained in series of images. Then, some of the students received instructions to learn and memorise a set of actions over the course of the following week – the actions included raising the hand above the head and in front of the body, bowing the head, and opening and closing the eyes. The researchers sent the participants regular reminders to encourage compliance with these instructions.\n\nAt the end of the week, the participants came to the lab to complete a group-based task. Participants believed they had been grouped together as the “red” team because they had all underestimated the number of dots in the images presented earlier in the week, students who had overestimated the number of dots were supposedly grouped in the “blue” team. In reality, the students were randomly assigned to groups.\n\nThey spent two minutes performing the action sequence one last time in a staggered fashion, so that the group performed the same actions but not quite simultaneously. Then, each group member sat down at a computer and played two rounds of a trust game with either another member of their “red” group or a member of the other “blue” group.\n\nIn each round, participants started with $10 and could choose to send any amount, from $0 to $10, to the other player. Whatever amount they sent would be tripled and the other player could then send money back. In a perfectly cooperative game, the participant would send $10, which would be tripled to $30, and the other player would then split the proceeds and send $15 back.\n\nThe researchers wanted to know: Would participants’ trust depend on whether the other player had been in their group and shared the same ritual?\n\nThe results supported the researchers’ hypothesis: Sharing a ritual influenced trust. Participants who had gone through the ritual experience entrusted less money to the other player if she was part of the other “blue” team than if she had been on the same “red” team. Participants in the comparison condition, who had not learned a ritual, sent similar amounts of money to the other player regardless of what team she was on.\n\nThus, knowing that they either did or did not share an arbitrary ritual with the other player was sufficient to bias the amount of trust participants placed in that player.\n\nThe results from two additional experiments revealed that the amount of effort and time put into the ritual do matter. Hobson and colleagues found that rituals that were simple or performed only once did not lead participants to show bias against members of the other group.\n\nBrain activity data collected in fourth experiment offer preliminary evidence that rituals may involve early, automatic processes associated with monitoring others’ behaviour. These processes may help to explain why group membership and affiliation are such influential social cues.\n\n“Rituals are a clear, honest, outward-directed signal that a person is part of, and loyal to, a particular group,” Hobson noted. “But now we see evidence that it might also be a clear signal that a person is an outsider. Could it be the case that rituals are responsible for fuelling the various forms of out-group derogation, distrust and hostility seen across the world? More work is certainly needed to flesh this out, but our work brings the question to the fore.”\n\nThe study is published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science.\n\nFollow @htlifeandstyle for more.', '2017-05-08 18:28:08', 'i452.jpg', 5, 0.65, 'Participants who had gone through the ritual experience entrusted less money to the other player if she was part of the other “blue” team than if she had been on the same “red” team.The researchers wanted to know: Would participants’ trust depend on whether the other player had been in their group and shared the same ritual?Hobson added that they found that a person who engages in an ad-hoc ritual over the course of a week will entrust more of their own money to a group member who went through the same ritual experience, and also entrust less money to someone who had a slightly different ritual experience.Thus, knowing that they either did or did not share an arbitrary ritual with the other player was sufficient to bias the amount of trust participants placed in that player.Then, some of the students received instructions to learn and memorise a set of actions over the course of the following week – the actions included raising the hand above the head and in front of the body, bowing the head, and opening and closing the eyes.', 3, 24, 61, 8, 1),

I am glad it is done finally,” Tendulkar said. Majumdar persuaded the cricketing legend to part with the gloves he was wearing, so they could be turned into a museum exhibit.

The bird-and-vine filled pattern is evocative of Kashmiri embroidery; the zardosi and sequins are typical of Surat; the crescents at the edges are auspicious symbols for Zoroastrians.

But in Himalayan cultures, they are believed to help destroy obstacles. Also called a magic dagger, this tantric object is used in rituals to conquer evil spirits. This 18th-century one has three blades that signify the three virtues (charity, chastity and patience) that can destroy the three vices (hatred, lust and sloth). The gallery also exhibits rare thangka paintings, 16th-century bronze sculptures, a 17th-century bone apron worn by the lamas or spiritual leaders, and other works from Nepal and Tibet.\n\n.\n\nThe court of Sikh emperor Ranjit Singh\n\nSee it at... The Viraat-E-Khalsa Museum in Anandpur Sahib, Punjab, which has added 13 new galleries last year.\n\nThe sprawling Viraat-E-Khalsa museum of Sikh history uses realistic motorised puppets, gigantic murals, film projections and 3D paintings to tell its stories. This double panorama depicts the coronation of Ranjit Singh in 1801, a move that unified local clans and helped forge Sikh identity under what came to be called the Sikh Empire (1799-1849). Records of the time describe Singh’s court as lavish. The museum display is similarly breath-taking. The illuminated backdrop creates a film-set effect, while the panorama walls act as a screen – a horse moving on one wall disappears to seamlessly emerge on the other.\n\n.\n\nArt that doubles as a postcard\n\nSee it here Ahmedabad’s Kasturbhai Lalbhai Museum, which displays the personal collection of the Lalbhai industrialist family, and includes paintings, Tibetan thangkas, sculptures and rare artworks, opened in January.\n\nWhen the painter Mukul Dey dropped his Bengal Art School teacher, Gaganendranath Tagore, a postcard in April 1915, he wasn’t scribbling the usual ‘Wish you were here’. The student was honouring the school’s unusual tradition of keeping in touch with an instructor who had become a friend.\n\nHe was also nodding to the future as much as the past. The following year, Dey would accompany Rabindranath Tagore on his first trip to Japan, learning printmaking from Japanese artists. Dey would later travel to America to learn to etch, a style he eventually preferred over what he learned in Japan.\n\nThis postcard is from a collection of about 40 sent by various Bengal School students from 1913 to 1940.

(456, 'Tried and Tasted: The best place for aloo sabji-poori in Delhi? Look no further', 'A revolution knocks on the door – and it comes with a fork and knife. The world of food is more exciting than ever before. New restaurants are coming up offering novel cuisines or digging out old ones. Chefs are looking at unusual ingredients and dramatic ways of presenting food. Meanwhile, some wizened old experts continue to wield magic with their skewers and ladles in remote parts of the city. There is a world waiting to be discovered or re-embraced– new cooking styles, world food, sub-regional cuisine and tiny holes in the wall which produce the most delightful dishes. Here’s a guided tour.\n\nWhen I was a young lad – in those prehistoric times when the Internet was still a dream and the television largely stuck to agriculture – my Sunday mornings consisted of a long walk from Rafi Marg to Daryaganj. I would browse through the books being sold on the pavements, and after having picked up a few well-thumbed volumes, I would amble up to Chawri Bazaar. There, my first stop was Shyam Sweets, where I had an early lunch – a plate of bedmi and aloo sabzi, which on Sundays came with a special pumpkin side dish.\n\nThe shop has been there since 1910, and was started by a gentleman called Anandimal Baburam who came from Allahabad to Delhi. The eatery is now run by the fifth generation of the family, notably two brothers called Sanjay and Ajay Aggarwal.\n\nOne of the landmarks of Delhi, it serves breakfast fare, sweets and the snacks that you need to fill yourself with at teatime, or even for dinner. The mornings are reserved for bedmi aloo -- bedmi being a much loved puri layered with a paste of urad dal. It is served with a mildly spiced potato curry, lightly cooked chholey and a dollop of some tart fenugreek (methi) chutney. And on Sundays, you’ll get a helping of the old pumpkin sabzi that had me hooked.\n\nI think this was the first eatery in Old Delhi that I ever visited. On Bud Shah Bullah lane, the T junction of Chawri Bazaar and Nai Sarak, the shop was then a nondescript little place, behind which was a well which gave you water that was wonderfully cold and sweet. Water to the houses in the neighbourhood went from this well, I am told. Now it has been walled up.\n\nShyam Sweets has also expanded over the years. They have added counters around which people stand and eat. Apart from bedmi aloo, it is also known for its muttar kachoris which are sold in the evenings. The bedmis get over by 2 pm, and the cooks then get ready to fry the pea-filled kachoris.\n\nYou bite into your bedmi or kachori, and take a swig from a tall glass of frothy lassi. If you want to end your meal with something sweet, you could try out the rabri, rasmalai, or the ghiya ki launj – which is a delicious sweet prepared with bottle gourd.\n\nOne of the most endearing aspects of Old Delhi is the fact that you can leave home with a 100-rupee note, and actually return with some change. A plate of bedmi aloo with 2 bedmis is for 40, and if you want four pieces of nagori with halwa added to it, the meal comes for Rs 50. Nagori is a small puffy disc, prepared with flour and semolina. You make a small hole in it, fill it with halwa and then eat it.\n\nAnd the other remarkable fact is that these once-little-and-now-big eateries have withstood the onslaught of time. Though Ghantewallah, a sweet shop set up in 1790, closed down in 2015 , many of the old food places are still going strong. And more power to them, I say.\n\n(Rahul Verma has been writing on food for over 25 years now.

Chopra’s first stop was Chitungwiza, south of Harare, Zimbabwe, where she met a 13-year-old girl who spoke about the sexual abuse she went through. Before Priyanka, Angelia Jolie who is the Goodwill Ambassador for UNHCR took up the cause to fight for the rights of refugees and displaced people.\n\nTalking about it, Priyanka says, “When I met these survivors - young brave women and children - and listened to their experiences, it just broke my heart. I will never forget their stories. Sadly, her story was just one of many stories I heard from the brave young girls. No woman, and most definitely no child, should ever have to experience sexual violence,” says Priyanka.\n\nOn the second day of her visit, Priyanka visited Childline Zimbabwe, the country’s 24-hour service for children who have been abused, violated or exploited. She then visited the Childline call-in centre to meet the helpline counsellors and listen to some of the calls being fielded in real-time. “I was astonished by the number of calls that came in during the brief time that I was there. The counsellors and volunteers told me that many calls come from children in hysterics because they have been raped or abused. They were so scared. Without Childline, they would have nowhere to turn. This is a model that many countries with high rates of violence against children can adopt. It is a safe place for children to turn to and know that their call will be answered by a compassionate person who will take their complaints seriously and respond.”\n\nTalking about the initiative, she said, “As a society, it is on us to provide and take care of our children as citizens of the world, to educate children at a young age and make them aware that it’s not okay to be inappropriately touched, and that under-age sex can lead to unwanted teen pregnancy or HIV.”\n\nThe next day, Priyanka also hosted UNICEF South Africa’s first Gala event in Johannesburg to raise funds for UNICEF’s work for children in South Africa.', '2017-05-08 18:49:20', 'i467.jpg', 7, -0.15, 'It is a safe place for children to turn to and know that their call will be answered by a compassionate person who will take their complaints seriously and respond.”\n\nTalking about the initiative, she said, “As a society, it is on us to provide and take care of our children as citizens of the world, to educate children at a young age and make them aware that it’s not okay to be inappropriately touched, and that under-age sex can lead to unwanted teen pregnancy or HIV.”\n\nThe next day, Priyanka also hosted UNICEF South Africa’s first Gala event in Johannesburg to raise funds for UNICEF’s work for children in South Africa.She then visited the Childline call-in centre to meet the helpline counsellors and listen to some of the calls being fielded in real-time.The counsellors and volunteers told me that many calls come from children in hysterics because they have been raped or abused.UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Priyanka Chopra was in Zimbabwe last week, to meet children who are victims of sexual violence.On the second day of her visit, Priyanka visited Childline Zimbabwe, the country’s 24-hour service for children who have been abused, violated or exploited.', 3, 24, 61, 8, 1),

(483, '19 years of Duplicate: Juhi Chawla reveals why she bonded with Shah Rukh Khan', 'Actor Juhi Chawla was already an established name in the film industry and among the A-list heroines when she worked in the 1998 film, Duplicate, starring Shah Rukh Khan in a double role. As the film completes 19 years of its release today, Juhi reveals how, initially ,she was not convinced about being a part of it.\n\n“I was in two minds because my character was not really doing anything substantial in the film. It was a sweet role but there was nothing to make me jump at . I remember I was working with Shah Rukh in Yes Boss (1997) at that time and after the shooting, we were at some bungalow in Mumbai when he sat me down and gave me a whole lecture for more than an hour on why I should be doing the film [Duplicate]. After sitting and listening to him for so long, I was like ‘okay, fine, maybe it’s not so bad and I am not looking at it correctly’, so that’s how I agreed to then do the film,” shares Juhi. The film was directed by Mahesh Bhatt and produced by Yash Johar.\n\nActors Shah Rukh Khan and Juhi Chawla in a still from the 1998 film Duplicate.\n\nJuhi and Shah Rukh’s friendship goes back a long way, since they worked together in films such as Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman (1992), Darr (1993), Parmatma (1994) and Ram Jaane (1995). However, Juhi says that it was only during the shoot of Duplicate that she got close to SRK and they shared a great bond thereafter. Getting emotional while talking about the reason, Juhi says, “I lost my mother while shooting for Duplicate. We had reached Prague and it was Karan’s [Johar] birthday the next day, so my mother and I bought a gift for him. Next morning, before I went for the shoot, she left for a walk and never came back. It was very traumatic because just a day before we had reached there and three days later, after she met with an accident, we were bringing her back in a coffin. It was devastating for me.”\n\nOne person who was by Juhi’s side in this difficult phase was Shah Rukh and she says perhaps that’s one of the reasons she knows him so well. “He was the person who consoled me, as he had seen his parents pass away before that and knew the pain of losing a parent. So, he was trying to make me laugh and forget things.”\n\nI went through the mourning period but then I realised that the only way to come around back to life was to go back to work and I did go back for Duplicate and Yes Boss—both were with Shah Rukh.\n\nDays after her mother’s demise, Juhi recalls that it still took her a long time to come to terms with reality. “I went through the mourning period but then I realised that the only way to come back to life was to go back to work and I did go back for Duplicate and Yes Boss—both were with Shah Rukh. Soon, I would look forward to the day because I knew I’d see him [SRK] there and somehow he’ll be fun and I’ll forget for that while what has happened and be okay with it as a bad dream. So in a way, he was special because he could just help me through that very difficult time of my life. So I have bitter sweet memories of this film.”\n\nAsk her if she’s aware of the fact that Shah Rukh had taken a salary cut for Duplicate , Juhi says she doesn’t remember him telling her anything about this. “[Also] at that time, I was very young, so I didn’t go into all these things. I didn’t realise maybe, or he didn’t mention it to me. But he was a joy to work with,” says Juhi, adding how SRK would help everyone on the sets. “He would be very helpful. Even the director and producer would feel reassured that Shah Rukh is there, so things would go fine. He will work out the scenes, will help write and rehearse them,” says the actor.\n\nSharing another anecdote from Duplicate sets, Juhi reveals that often Karan Johar used to rewrite the scenes. “If ever we felt that a scene wasn’t written well, Karan would actually sit down and write it for us. He wasn’t really assisting in the film but he was always around on the sets. He’s very gifted with scenes, especially those involving high profile people, so there were quite a few that he helped us with,” quips Juhi.\n\nFollow @htshowbiz for more', '2017-05-08 19:01:02', 'i484.jpg', 7, 0.4, 'So, he was trying to make me laugh and forget things.”\n\nI went through the mourning period but then I realised that the only way to come around back to life was to go back to work and I did go back for Duplicate and Yes Boss—both were with Shah Rukh.“I went through the mourning period but then I realised that the only way to come back to life was to go back to work and I did go back for Duplicate and Yes Boss—both were with Shah Rukh.I remember I was working with Shah Rukh in Yes Boss (1997) at that time and after the shooting, we were at some bungalow in Mumbai when he sat me down and gave me a whole lecture for more than an hour on why I should be doing the film [Duplicate].Actor Juhi Chawla was already an established name in the film industry and among the A-list heroines when she worked in the 1998 film, Duplicate, starring Shah Rukh Khan in a double role.He wasn’t really assisting in the film but he was always around on the sets.', 4, 24, 60, 8, 1);

But yes, I have worked on two films adapted from his novels. I think I never faced any problem on that because none of my directors suggested me to read them and those scripts were pretty substantial for me to understand the character. Since in both the films, Chetan was a part of the scripting process, I am sure he kept the essence of the character,” the actor said.\n\nArjun Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor are starring together for the first time in Half Girlfriend.\n\nArjun earlier featured in 2 States opposite Alia Bhatt and will soon be seen along side Shraddha Kapoor in Mohit Suri’s Half Girlfriend - both based on Bhagat’s books.\n\nDirected by Mohit Suri, Half Girlfriend revolves around the journey of a man from Bihar who faces difficulty in getting accustomed to urban life and get college admission due to his lack of command over the English language.\n\nTalking about the issue, Arjun said it always happens in real life as people’s mind is conditioned in such a manner that we tend to think that knowing English makes a person intelligent and smart.\n\n“In my daily life, if someone is not comfortable to speak in English, I quickly start speaking in Hindi as I am at ease with both the languages. But judging someone based on that... I don’t do that consciously. However, the thought (of the other person not knowing English) crosses our mind for once,” Arjun said.\n\n“We develop this mentality where knowing English is mandatory to get work opportunity, and to socialise with urban people... So it’s an unsaid thought developed in our subconscious mind,” he added.\n\n“I think this is a very special film because he has given me arguably the best and toughest role yet. My character Madhav Jha is a selfless man who is preparing himself to do something good for his villagers, especially women. You really do not get a chance to play such a character in a love story in the present time. And working with Mohit made me live through the character.

I don’t want to let my listeners suffer,” said Rahman.\n\n“Before taking up a project, there is research done at first. It needs to excite me. So far I have done what I had energy to do and will keep doing that. The project needs to make me sleepless to deliver something satisfactory. I just look how passionate the other person is about the project, irrespective of the language or place that he belongs to,” added the 50-year-old, who has completed 25 years in the music industry since the release of the 1992 film Roja.\n\nBesides India, where he is known by the Mozart of Madras sobriquet, Rahman has carved out a niche for himself in the West through his impactful and award-winning compositions in films like Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours and Pele. He has also composed music for Iranian and British movies.\n\nAbout Hollywood, he feels watching movies from the American market has been part of India’s movie-going culture. “We have been seeing Hollywood films since a long time now. It has become a part of our culture. I have been watching them since childhood. It’s part of me now,” Rahman said.\n\nOn whether his approach to Hollywood projects is any different as compared to his work in Indian movies, the composer said, “It’s about wearing different hats... When we go to a party, we speak in a different way, and when we speak to our mother or a friend, then we speak in a different way. It comes naturally when you are involved in it.”\n\nFor now, Rahman is upbeat about his latest tryst with technology -- Le Musk, a Virtual Reality (VR) multi-sensory episodic film which has been shot across various locations in Rome. He has not just directed it, but has also written it.\n\nRahman said he was introduced to the technology in 2015. He was hesitant to try it, but got so hooked on to it that he would spend as many as six hours a day working with it.\n\nBut how did the concept of Le Musk emerge? “One day I was chatting with my wife (Saira Banu) and she is fond of perfumes. So, she said, ‘Why don’t you make a movie on perfumes?’ It was actually her initiative. That time I wanted to create a theatre with projections all over and have scent added to it -- just as an experiment. But, in three months, somebody gave me a headset and then my wife said don’t create a theatre and rather do it with VR, which is evolving.”\n\n“It was a kind of an experiment and I loved doing it.

Like MG Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu, and NT Rama Rao in erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, Rajinikanth’s fans expect him to join politics sooner or later.\n\nHowever the star has himself always stayed away from the topic. One of the reasons for speculations surrounding Rajinikanth’s political foray is his personal camaraderie with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In April 2014, just before the polls, Modi had called on Rajinikanth in Chennai while on a campaign trail. Though both Modi and Rajinikanth called it a ‘courtesy call’, many saw political undertones to it. With the demise of Jayalalithaa, it is expected that a politically ambitious BJP would try to strengthen its presence in Tamil Nadu.\n\nFollow @htshowbiz for more', '2017-05-08 19:06:29', 'i493.jpg', 7, 0.25, 'The Baasha actor posted pictures of her meeting with the superstar and immediately it triggered political speculation of the Tamil supersar joining politics.With the demise of Jayalalithaa, it is expected that a politically ambitious BJP would try to strengthen its presence in Tamil Nadu.One of the reasons for speculations surrounding Rajinikanth’s political foray is his personal camaraderie with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Sharing the pictures, she tweeted, “In conversation with my favourite #co-star and friend #Rajnikant from Baasha met him today was so nice to catch up wth him in various issues.”\n\nIn conversation with my favourite #costar and friend #Rajnikant from Baasha met him today was so nice to catch up wth him in various issues pic.twitter.com/CGdshX5wLM — Nagma Morarji (@nagma_morarji) May 7, 2017\n\nWhen asked about his chances of joining politics, she said many people have huge expectations from Rajinikanth and added that “if he comes politics he will be very successful and he will be very good”, reports Times of India.Rajinikanth’s entry into politics has been the subject of speculations for many years.', 4, 24, 60, 8, 1),

You identify what clicked with audiences, and you find ways to recreate those emotions and beats, presumably with slight variations and a general air of bigness that makes it seem – at least subconsciously – that what you’re seeing is an improvement on what you expected.\n\nBut if the first Guardians movie, on a spiritual level, mirrored the joy of the first Star Wars film, Vol 2, emotionally, is the Empire Strikes Back of the series.\n\nIn it, Peter Quill meets his father, who opens his future up to new possibilities, but also drags to the forefront the baggage of his past.\n\nThis image released by Disney-Marvel shows Kurt Russell in a scene from, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2. (AP)\n\nBut no matter what your expectations from it, or from sequels in general, Gunn finds a way to subvert them all. He will deliver on the superficial – the soundtrack has bigger, more familiar hits; Groot is, in his new avatar as Baby Groot, an even greater scene-stealer than he was before; and this time, the villain does not succumb to Chris Pratt’s dance moves – but this is all just a means for Gunn to explore the heart of his story: Family. The real deal, not that nonsense the Fast & Furious movies have been feeding us. It’s a convenient barter that he has struck – with an overbearing studio, toy manufacturers, and with us – to tell the story he wants to, one about fathers and sons, childhood trauma, and parenthood.\n\nVol 2 succeeds on its own merit, and not by cashing in on the love we have for the first one. It makes characters we didn’t think twice about in the first movie – busy as we were wondering what a Rocket and Groot spinoff would look like –the stars in this one.\n\nThis image released by Disney shows the Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper, left, and Groot, voiced by Vin Diesel in a scene from Marvel''s Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2. (AP)\n\nIt is true that not many people would want their superhero movies to carry the emotional heft of a Pixar film – especially a Marvel superhero movie, movies that have become notorious for dressing the same skeleton with colourful new costumes and calling it a new franchise – but, as it turns out, I did. Because Marvel is at its best when a visionary filmmaker steps in, if only briefly, and shows us what creative freedom can produce. It happened with the first and third Iron Man films, the first Avengers, the second Captain America, and, of course, Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nJames Gunn’s sequel is perhaps the most visually inventive Marvel has ever been, despite the psychedelia of Doctor Strange. It prompted me, for the second time in a row after last year’s The Legend of Tarzan, to note the talents of cinematographer Henry Braham. There isn’t a colour on the spectrum that he doesn’t use to light the gloriously crafted sets, and the faces of actors performing with great sincerity.\n\nThis image released by Disney-Marvel shows Elizabeth Debicki in a scene from, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2.

(506, 'Will Roman Polanski with his new film have a good time at Cannes?', 'Poor Roman Polanski has had trying times for much of his 83 years. So, when an event like the Cannes Film Festival knocks on his door, one is sure that the renowned Polish auteur would be if not overjoyed, at least reasonably happy that a bright spark or two appears in his life from time to time. His latest movie, Based On A True Story, has been picked by Cannes to be screened at the festival’s second most important section, Outside Competition.\n\nThere is a clear edge in having one’s film slotted away from the main Competition -- where the pressure to win is enormous - and when all the hard work yields no trophies, the disappointment can be shattering. This writer has come across many directors who have not been quite happy about their movies playing in Competition, vying with 18 or 20 others for one of the most prestigious awards in the world of cinema, the Palm d Ór.\n\nAlso, the press at Cannes can be brutal and tear a film to shreds. The all-exclusive press shows, for instance, can be a humiliating experience for a helmer whose work may not be - in the eyes of critics - up to a certain standard. One remembers how a movie like Vincent Gallo’s Brown Bunny in 2003 was mercilessly booed by journalists. Then, there was also the case of one of Shaji N Karun’s Malayalam work at Cannes Competition whose screening mercifully did not attract booing, but saw most of the viewers walking out. It is quite possible that the largely Western media did not quite understand the nuances of a film that was essentially Indian/Keralum.\n\nBased On A True Story stars actor Eva Green.\n\nReturning to Roman Polanski, his Based On A True Story is a thriller with Eva Green essaying a mysterious woman -- who tries to enter the life of a celebrated author, portrayed by the director’s wife, Emmanuelle Seigner.\n\nBased On A True Story is inspired by a novel with the same name penned by Delphine De Vigan. A review of the book (which I have not read) in The Guardian has this to say: “The narrator is a writer named Delphine; she lives in Paris with her two teenage children, is in a relationship with a well-known journalist called François, and has recently achieved success with an autobiographical novel about her family, resulting in strained relationships with relatives who did not welcome the exposure. Thus far, the details correlate with what is known of the author. But this is fiction - isn’t it?\n\n“The real De Vigan’s previous book, Nothing Holds Back the Night, overtly addressed the fraught boundary between memoir and fiction and the question of the author’s licence to invent; Based on a True Story takes the idea a stage further. In the novel, Delphine is crippled by writer’s block after the double-edged response to her last book (never explicitly named here); she begins to receive poison pen letters, apparently from a member of her family accusing her in vicious terms of lying and exploitation. As her crisis progresses towards severe depression, Delphine encounters the enigmatic L at a party. L is intimately familiar with Delphine’s work; an admirer who quickly insinuates herself into Delphine’s life.”\n\nThe review goes on to add that for a psychological thriller the book is slow. The question now is, will Polanski be able to infuse greater thrill and excitement into his celluloid work?\n\nIf this may be causing a bit of worry for Polanski, there can be other factors which he might have to grapple with. One, Cannes has slotted his work at the fag end of the festival when most people would have gone. Two, while Polanski’s lawyers continue to fight for his return to America - which he left 40 years ago after being convicted of raping a minor girl, and has since then been living in different parts of Europe - the US has refused to grant him any special treatment on its soil. This means that there is still a possibility of Polanski having to spend time in prison if he returns to America.\n\n(File Photo) Filmmaker Roman Polanski’s film will be screened in the Outside Competition section. (REUTERS)\n\nBeyond all this, one is not sure about the treatment Polanski will get at Cannes. True, he did not face any hostility when he went to the festival in 2013 with his Venus in Fur. But, let us not forget that the world is now getting increasingly intolerant, and this writer saw this ugliness last year at Cannes when Woody Allen’s estranged son, Ronan Farrow, wrote an unflattering article in The Hollywood Reporter about his father’s ‘sexual abuse’. There were some who felt that The Hollywood Reporter should not have carried the story during the festival. The timing was completely inappropriate. Cannes should not be made into a platform for trading allegations and counter-allegations.\n\nHowever, one hopes that given Polanski’s age and his one devastating personal tragedy in which his eight-month pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, along with four others was gruesomely murdered in her Los Angeles house in 1969 by the Manson family, the auteur would be treated with respect and courtesy.\n\nFinally, it must be said that Cannes is a venue for cinema and the festival must not be allowed to degenerate into a hotspot of slanging match. What happened with Allen last year was in sheer bad taste.\n\n(Gautaman Bhaskaran will cover the landmark 70th edition of the Cannes Film Festival, running from May 17 to 28.)\n\nFollow @htshowbiz for more', '2017-05-08 19:13:37', 'i507.jpg', 7, -0.45, 'A review of the book (which I have not read) in The Guardian has this to say: “The narrator is a writer named Delphine; she lives in Paris with her two teenage children, is in a relationship with a well-known journalist called François, and has recently achieved success with an autobiographical novel about her family, resulting in strained relationships with relatives who did not welcome the exposure.His latest movie, Based On A True Story, has been picked by Cannes to be screened at the festival’s second most important section, Outside Competition.Returning to Roman Polanski, his Based On A True Story is a thriller with Eva Green essaying a mysterious woman -- who tries to enter the life of a celebrated author, portrayed by the director’s wife, Emmanuelle Seigner.“The real De Vigan’s previous book, Nothing Holds Back the Night, overtly addressed the fraught boundary between memoir and fiction and the question of the author’s licence to invent; Based on a True Story takes the idea a stage further.So, when an event like the Cannes Film Festival knocks on his door, one is sure that the renowned Polish auteur would be if not overjoyed, at least reasonably happy that a bright spark or two appears in his life from time to time.', 4, 24, 60, 8, 1),

It was also the first time that standbys were named.\n\nRohit Sharma, the opening batsman, too, returns to the set-up after having been ruled out for four months in November last year due to a thigh injury. He has played all of Mumbai''s games so far this season in the IPL after returning to competitive cricket in March.\n\nWhile KL Rahul hasn''t sufficiently recovered from his shoulder injury, Ravichandran Ashwin, the ace offspinner, who missed the ongoing IPL with a sports hernia injury, was named, along with Ravindra Jadeja, with the duo to share spin responsibilities.\n\nAshwin, who played a crucial role in helping India hoist the Champions Trophy in 2013, picking up eight scalps at an average of 22.62, was rested for the duration of the IPL - something that was confirmed by MSK Prasad. "Ashwin''s selection was not a difficult decision. He''s had rest, isn''t out of form. We''ve been preparing him for the Champions Trophy" said MSK Prasad, the chairman of selectors after the announcement.\n\nOne of the major talking points prior to the announcement was whether Ajinkya Rahane would retain his place in the set-up. The elegant batsman has been in average form in the ongoing IPL, evidenced by the fact that he has compiled just 248 runs at an average of 20.66. However, the Prasad-led selection panel showed their faith in the veteran batsman by naming him for England as the back-up opener (Rohit and Shikhar Dhawan being the primary ones), along with Yuvraj Singh, whose one-day career was revived after being picked for the series against England in January.\n\nManish Pandey was also named in the 15-member squad. The enterprising batsman hasn''t played for the national side in the 50-over format since the series against New Zealand in October last year despite being selected for the subsequent ODI series against England.\n\nMS Dhoni was the lone wicketkeeper named in the squad. When asked about the decision and concerns with his form, Prasad didn''t stop short of lavishing praise on the former Indian skipper saying that the experienced campaigner has been a fine performer for India under pressure situations in the abridged versions of the game, also commending his glovework.\n\n"We all believe that MSD is still the best wicketkeeper in the world," said Prasad. "Focussing on his batting form, he is an invaluable asset to the team when it comes to crunch situations. His inputs... and he has got one of the best brains. He is the best person to guide Virat. Not many people realise that in the last 10-12 years that MS has played, he has never had a bad day as far his gloves are concerned. We always treat him as a batsman but the phenomenal stuff that he does behind the wickets, not many people appreciate."\n\nRishabh Pant, the dashing wicketkeeper-batsman, was also considered for selection but missed out. The 19-year-old had plundered 972 runs at an average of 81 to go with an astonishing strike rate of 107 in the 2016-17 Ranji season.\n\n"We are completely impressed with Rishabh Pant. But he missed out because of squad combination. We will groom him for the future," noted Prasad. The former wicketkeeper-batsman also pointed out that the selectors had pondered over whether to select Kuldeep Yadav, the slow left-arm unorthodox bowler, who he said "missed out narrowly".\n\nThe chinaman bowler took a four-wicket haul on his Test debut against Australia in Dharamsala. He has also picked up nine wickets at an average of 31.22 in the IPL 2017.\n\nIn addition, apart from Pant and Kuldeep, the others who were considered and will be kept as stand-by options are Dinesh Karthik, Suresh Raina and Shardul Thakur, for who visas are being sorted out.

We haven''t batted (first) much. We just wanted to try something different and it didn''t pay off. We have two more games left. We need to regroup as soon as we can and try to turn it around.

When asked regarding Dhoni’s batting position for the Champions Trophy, Prasad said: “That is up to the combination and let the team management decide that.”\n\n“We considered Rishabh Pant, Kuldeep Yadav, Suresh Raina, Dinesh Karthik and Shardul Thakur. They are in our standby list for the Champions Trophy. We discussed Kuldeep. He narrowly missed out, but has a big role to play in future.

We’re extremely pleased with Rishabh and will groom him too,” added Prasad.\n\nSeveral youngsters who have performed brilliantly in the IPL were not considered for the 15-member Champions Trophy squad announced in New Delhi on Monday. Prasad, however, assured that the Indian youngsters are on their radar.\n\n“IPL is a very, very glamorous tournament. It is our premier domestic tournament and best tournament in the world. There are no two ways about it. When we consider for a 50-over tournament, we have to see other aspects as well.\n\n“We have to see all-round capabilities as well. Yes, we are really happy that some of the boys like (Rahul) Tripathi, Basil Thampi and the way they are shaping up (sic).

Cito aims to remove awkward moments associated with using smartwatches by improving how the device presents data to the wearer.\n\nScientists have developed a new smartwatch with a display that moves in five different directions – dramatically improving functionality and addressing limitations of today’s fixed-face watches. The watch, named Cito, has the ability to rotate, hinge, translate, rise and orbit.\n\nBeyond making the watches more convenient for users, the technology can provide important benefits to wearers with physical disabilities or other impairments, researchers said. “Users want smartwatches that fit their lifestyles and needs,” said Xing-Dong Yang, assistant professor at Dartmouth College in the US. “The Cito prototype is an exciting innovation that could give consumers even more great reasons to wear smartwatches,” said Yang.\n\nMost smartwatch research primarily addresses how users can more easily input information.Cito aims to remove awkward moments associated with using smartwatches by improving how the device presents data to the wearer.\n\nExamples of watch movement include automatically orbiting around the wristband to allow viewing when the wrist is facing away from the user; rising to alert the wearer of a notification if the user is playing a game; hinging to allow a companion to view the watch face; and translating to reveal the watch face from underneath a shirt sleeve.\n\nAlso Read: Apple ‘iPhone 8’ mass production on schedule, likely to go on sale in October: Report\n\n“Consumers will question the need for smartwatches if the devices are just not convenient enough.

(Source: Bloomberg) Minori Takechi’s Tokyo based startup is betting that people will want to forge an emotional relationship with a digital assistant. (Source: Bloomberg)\n\nWhen Siri is asked whether she has a boyfriend, the iPhone’s digital assistant is usually quick to deflect the question with a quip about drones always trying to pick her up. For Minori Takechi, founder of Vinclu Inc., that’s a missed opportunity.\n\nTakechi is the creator of Hikari Azuma, a miniskirt-wearing avatar. She can hold a basic conversation and wake you up in the morning by turning on the lights. Hikari will message you at work and greet you when you return home. She’ll also set you back about $2,700.\n\nWhile Amazon.com Inc. and Google are barreling ahead with efforts to get voice-operated speaker assistants into consumers’ homes, Takechi says these products are too focused on delivering utility. Instead, his Tokyo-based startup is betting that people will want to forge an emotional relationship with a digital assistant.\n\n“My vision is a world where people can share their daily lives with their favorite fictional characters,” Takechi, 29, said. “We live in a time when all kinds of robots start making their way into our homes. But much of what you see now is inorganic and mechanical and I doubt people will want to communicate with something like that.”\n\nAlso Read: Apple could debut Siri-powered speaker as early as June: Report\n\nHikari lives in a coffee maker-sized glass cylinder called Gatebox, as a hologram-like projection on a screen. She doesn’t mind flirting. Say that you like her and Hikari will chirp back with “today, tomorrow and the day after!”\n\nIn its current form, Gatebox’s appeal may be limited to Japan, which has earned a (somewhat over-hyped) reputation for being a place where unmarried men would rather develop a relationship with a virtual girlfriend.\n\nThe good news is that the company plans to offer a variety of avatars, which could be anything from cartoon characters to sports heroes. Vinclu isn’t the only company betting that emotion will have to be a key ingredient for a robotic or AI companion. Groove X Inc., another Japanese startup, is working on a robot that “touches your heart.”\n\nAlso Read: Apple could launch its high-end ‘Siri Speaker’ at WWDC: Report\n\nWhen Takechi set out to raise money in early 2015, before Amazon’s Echo started to gain traction and Google Home debuted, most investors weren’t keen on backing a hardware project, he said. Still, he was able to raise an initial 20 million yen ($180,000) based on conceptual sketches. One early fan was Taizo Son, the younger brother of SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son.\n\nSo far, Vinclu has raised about 200 million yen from investors including Primal Capital and Incubate Fund. Line Corp., Japan’s biggest instant messaging company, bought a majority stake in the startup in March as part of its push into AI.\n\n“Combining Gatebox know-how and technology with our own Clova AI platform will allow us to develop a new kind of post-display, post-touch agent capable of making the lives of the users richer and more fun,” said Jun Masuda, Line’s chief strategy and marketing officer. The company is planning to launch its own tabletop speaker called Wave in early summer.\n\nAlso Read: WhatsApp for iOS now lets Siri read your messages\n\nGatebox is still a long way from offering real companionship, and its repertoire is limited to just a handful of scripted interactions. But Line’s backing will give Takechi access to richer AI capabilities and an ecosystem of services that go far beyond messaging. More than 171 million subscribers in Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia use Line to read the news, hail taxi rides and find part-time jobs.\n\nNot everyone is sold on the tech industry’s rush toward voice assistants. Although Amazon’s Echo and Apple’s Siri give the impression they can answer anything, in reality that kind of general AI is still years away, according to Benedict Evans, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz. He warned in March that there’s a limit to how many voice commands people can memorize and that some may end up having negative emotional responses to things that seem almost human, but aren’t quite.\n\nVinclu’s answer to the limitations of voice is kawaii, the Japanese word for cute. Takechi said the company is developing behavior patterns that will let their characters make mistakes without getting on your nerves. The bet is that when a virtual girlfriend fails to order an Uber, you’re more likely to forgive her than a disembodied voice from a cylinder.\n\nAlso Read: Apple iOS 10.3 beta roll out: Siri will now show cricket updates\n\nTakechi’s formative experience was in the sub-Saharan nation of Malawi, where he moved at the age of 10 when his mother got a job helping the government fight malaria. Stuck in a town with one traffic light and a school where no one spoke his language, Takechi spent the two years holed up in his room with only Pokemon characters for company.\n\nThat gave him an understanding of otaku culture and planted the seed for Gatebox, he said. “The kind of communication we are focusing on isn’t your typical command-answer relationship,” Takechi said. “Kawaii is infallible.”\n\nFor all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-09 01:47:40', 'i581.jpg', 4, 0.2, 'Minori Takechi’s Tokyo based startup is betting that people will want to forge an emotional relationship with a digital assistant.(Source: Bloomberg) Minori Takechi’s Tokyo based startup is betting that people will want to forge an emotional relationship with a digital assistant.Instead, his Tokyo-based startup is betting that people will want to forge an emotional relationship with a digital assistant.Groove X Inc., another Japanese startup, is working on a robot that “touches your heart.”\n\nAlso Read: Apple could launch its high-end ‘Siri Speaker’ at WWDC: Report\n\nWhen Takechi set out to raise money in early 2015, before Amazon’s Echo started to gain traction and Google Home debuted, most investors weren’t keen on backing a hardware project, he said.But much of what you see now is inorganic and mechanical and I doubt people will want to communicate with something like that.”\n\nAlso Read: Apple could debut Siri-powered speaker as early as June: Report\n\nHikari lives in a coffee maker-sized glass cylinder called Gatebox, as a hologram-like projection on a screen.', 4, 24, 60, 8, 1),

(582, 'How Burger King revealed the hackability of voice assistants', 'Burger King pulled a pretty juicy marketing stunt last month that drew plenty of attention, not just to the Whopper, but also to the intrinsic vulnerabilities of a new type of voice-activated gadget.\n\nThe fast food chain’s 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said “OK, Google” and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger’s ingredients in homes around the country _ effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout “OK, Google, stop!”\n\nGoogle and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock all the doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security.\n\n“It’s a wakeup call,” said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. “It’s a harbinger of things to come.”\n\nTRIGGER WARNING\n\nVoice assistants such as Google Home, Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase “OK, Google” reportedly set off people’s devices. And in a January story that briefly turned a family into media celebrities, a woman’s 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa for them.\n\nAlso Read: Burger King debuts Whopper ad that triggers Google Home devices\n\nSince the devices are so new ,the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year, they’re still having growing pains. And they’re growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the US in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn’t release sales figures.\n\nMany experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. “Burger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage,” Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey said. “Very few brands want to do that.”\n\nOf course, spammers and other bottom-feeding marketers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them.\n\nTHREATS AND COUNTERMEASURES\n\nAmazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can’t inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with “skills” that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Neither company provided details on those techniques.\n\nAlso Read: Google Home’s assistant can now recognise up to six different voices\n\nVoice assistants are still in their “very early days,” Google says; the company plans to “monitor and learn as we go.” Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now.\n\n“It’s not that we won’t see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don’t think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime,” said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee.\n\nMORE SECURITY TO COME\n\nBut before long, the devices are going to need better security. “When you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we’re accustomed to, related to security for computers, change,” Gartner’s Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than say, shopping or accessing a bank account.\n\nAlso Read: Google Home reportedly played an ad for ‘Beauty and the Beast’\n\nAmazon already has options for setting up security codes to shop, make financial transactions or unlock and start cars.\n\nOf course, someone could always overhear you reciting a security phrase. A better solution, and one that companies are hard at work on, would be to identify a person’s voice, much the way Google and Facebook identify faces today. Beyond improving security, that technology could help the device personalize recommendations or even ads for the individual, not the whole family.\n\nApple already lets users voice-train its Siri digital assistant so it’s more likely to activate only when it hears a specific voice. Amazon has a voice training option for Alexa. Google Home can recognize up to six different voices, though it won’t prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant.\n\nAlso Read: Amazon rolls out chatbot tools in race to dominate voice-powered tech\n\nExperts suggest that companies will eventually add cameras to voice assistants. Amazon’s new Echo Look has a camera, but it’s for offering fashion advice. Combining a facial scan with voice recognition would definitely beef up security, although they’ll also create new privacy concerns.\n\n“Without any security or minimal security, (voice assistants are) going to be a fat target,” Perkins said. “There will be all kinds of innovation associated with compromising these systems.”\n\nFor all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-09 01:48:50', 'i583.jpg', 4, 0.1, 'Also Read: Google Home’s assistant can now recognise up to six different voices\n\nVoice assistants are still in their “very early days,” Google says; the company plans to “monitor and learn as we go.” Hackers might also be a threat.Also Read: Burger King debuts Whopper ad that triggers Google Home devices\n\nSince the devices are so new ,the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year, they’re still having growing pains.“It’s a harbinger of things to come.”\n\nTRIGGER WARNING\n\nVoice assistants such as Google Home, Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack.When an actor in the ad said “OK, Google” and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger’s ingredients in homes around the country _ effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout “OK, Google, stop!”\n\nGoogle and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down.It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security.', 4, 24, 60, 8, 1),

OnePlus confirmed this to The Verge, and as CEO Pete Lau has said earlier in a Weibo post, the phone will come with ‘a big surprise’.\n\nWe’ve seen quite a few leaks take place around the OnePlus 5, and there’s a lot of interest around this phone. Here are top features that you could expect from the OnePlus 5.\n\nDesign\n\nFirst up, the phone will be called OnePlus 5 because the number ‘four’ is supposed to be unlucky in China. Given the great run that OnePlus had with OnePlus 3, OnePlus 3T, the company wants to make sure nothing jinxes their next ‘flagship phone.’\n\nOn the design front, it doesn’t look like that OnePlus 5 will have too many changes. The all-metal unibody design of OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T will continue, though the top antenna lines could be more muted on the rear cover this time.\n\nOnePlus 5 will also sport a dual-camera set up on the back, and there have been conflicting reports on whether this will be stacked vertically or horizontally.

We’ll have to wait to know these till the phone launches later this summer.\n\nDisplay\n\nOnePlus 5 will likely stick with the 5.5-inch Full HD (1080p) SAMOLED display we saw on the previous OnePlus 3 and 3T smartphone. A 2K display is unlikely, and if that happens, it could push up the price of this phone.\n\nSpecifications\n\nOnePlus 5 will sport the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, according to leaks. OnePlus has in the past put the latest high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC in its phones, and it is unlikely they won’t follow the trend with the OnePlus 5.\n\nOn the RAM front, some rumours claim it will have 8GB RAM, while others says OnePlus will stick with 6GB RAM.

OnePlus 3 launched at Rs 27,999 in India for the 64GB version, and Rs 29,999 for the OnePlus 3T with 64 GB storage.

After this, you need to visit a Reliance Jio Store, Digital Xpress, etc, and take the original bill, the JioFi box, and your old dongle. If you don’t have the old dongle, then you still need to visit the store, if you want to claim the Rs 1005 benefits that Jio is handing out.\n\nOnce again, you will need to submit Proof of Address (POA), Proof of Identity (POI), and a passport size colour photograph in order to get the SIM for the JioFi device activated.\n\nJio has also put out a list of eligible dongles under this scheme, which can be handed over for exchange. The list includes dongles from Airtel, Idea, Vodafone, Tata, MTS, RCOM, Micromax, D-Link, Huawei, iBall, ZTE, Lava, Intex, Netgear and BSNL. You cannot hand in an old JioFi device for exchange.\n\nAfter you get the JioFi device activated, you will have to recharge with Rs 99 for the Prime membership followed by Rs 309 or Rs 509 for the Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan offer. After this offer is over (the first recharge in Dhan Dhana Dhan lasts for 84 days), you will need to get a minimum recharge of Rs 149 and above, in order to keep this activated.\n\nAfter the Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan offer period is over, your Dongle benefits will kick in, but there’s a catch here.\n\nJio’s detailed terms and conditions state, “to avail the benefit under the Offer, the Customer will have to do the recharge on monthly basis with a “MONTHLY” voucher.” So if you get a Rs 309 recharge as the first one, you’ll have to keep doing this every month, in order enjoy the free vouchers for your dongle. Jio’s terms and conditions also state, “The validity of the 5GB data will work co-terminus with that of the base plan.” The validity of these benefits is till March 31, 2018.\n\nThe offer is applicable under both pre-paid and postpaid plans. The JioFi device lets users access 4G Data, make VoLTE calls even on 2G or 3G smartphones, and can connect with up to 10 devices.\n\nFor all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd', '2017-05-09 01:52:11', 'i587.jpg', 4, 1, 'Reliance JioFi device has an 100 per cent cashback offer on exchange with an old dongle, router, 4G card: Here are the details.Reliance JioFi device has an 100 per cent cashback offer on exchange with an old dongle, router, 4G card: Here are the details.Reliance Jio is offering 100 per cent cashback for those who buy the JioFi device, and exchange an old dongle, router, 4G card along with this.After you get the JioFi device activated, you will have to recharge with Rs 99 for the Prime membership followed by Rs 309 or Rs 509 for the Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan offer.Jio has listed out the steps of how you can buy the JioFi device and get the old dongle exchanged.', 4, 24, 60, 8, 1),

(Source: US Patent and Trademark Office)\n\nSnapchat’s patent, published by the US Patent and Trademark Office, talks about seamlessly integrating Augmented Reality (AR) in real world scenarios. The technology uses GPS or similar system to determine a user’s location. After they’ve clicked a picture of a real world scenario (park for example), the technology then matches these images against its own set of image database to place digital objects in real world pictures.\n\nThe pre-programmed digital pictures are put in such a way that they look realistic and match the background of real world images. Pictures cam be clicked using AR glasses or helmet as well as smartphone camera app.\n\n“For example, video images of a wall output on a display of a device may be enhanced with display details that are not present on the wall, but that are generated to appear as if they are on the wall by an augmented reality system,” the patent reads.\n\nSuper-imposing digital images that look seamlessly integrated in to real world images isn’t easy. It requires a “complex mix” of matching image capture information with AR image database and super-imposing them in a way that output matches the intent with which the picture was taken.\n\nAR is the way forward for most social media platforms, with companies looking to do a lot more using camera app. At the F8 developer conference, Facebook showcased how it wants to make AR available across platforms, especially the camera.

(613, 'Supreme Court upholds CBI plea: Fodder ghosts back to haunt Lalu Prasad Yadav', 'Lalu Yadav was one of the first chief ministers to be associated with the fodder scam. (File) Lalu Yadav was one of the first chief ministers to be associated with the fodder scam. (File)\n\nIn a setback for RJD chief Lalu Prasad, the Supreme Court on Monday restored the conspiracy charges against him in cases related to the fodder scam. It also ruled that he would stand fresh trial in other cases linked to the alleged embezzlement of over Rs 900 crore in the scam when he was chief minister of Bihar.\n\nLalu has already been convicted in one case linked to the scam but the Jharkhand High Court had quashed conspiracy charges against him and other accused — former Bihar chief minister Jagannath Mishra and ex-bureaucrat Sajal Chakraborthy — in related cases on the ground that the offences listed arose from the same conspiracy.\n\nWhile delivering its ruling, the High Court had applied Article 20(2) of the Constitution, which says that no person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once.\n\nAlso Read: What is the fodder scam: A look at what all has happened since 1996\n\nOn Monday, allowing the CBI’s appeal against the High Court ruling, an apex court division bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Amitava Roy said that although there was “one general conspiracy”, the “offences are distinct for different periods”.\n\n“No doubt about it that the general conspiracy had been hatched as alleged for the period 1988 to 1996 but defalcations (misappropriation of funds) are from different treasuries for different financial years by exceeding the amount of each year which was allocated for the Animal Husbandry Department for each of the district…” the bench said.\n\n“The amount involved is different, fake vouchers, fake allotment letters, fake supply orders had been prepared with the help of different sets of accused persons. Though there is one general conspiracy, offences are distinct for different periods,” it said.\n\n“The Constitution bars double punishment for the same offence. The conviction for such offence does not bar for subsequent trial and conviction for another offence and it does not matter even if some ingredients of these two offences are common…,” the bench said.\n\n“Each defalcation would constitute an independent offence. Thus, by no stretch, it can be held to be in violation of Article 20(2) of the Constitution or Section 300 of CrPC. Separate trials in such cases is the very intendment of law. There is no room to raise such a grievance…,” the bench said.\n\n“The modus operandi being the same would not make it a single offence when the offences are separate. Commission of offence pursuant to a conspiracy has to be punished. If conspiracy is furthered into several distinct offences, there have to be separate trials,” it said.\n\n“There may be a situation where in furtherance of general conspiracy, offences take place in various parts of India and several persons are killed at different times. Each trial has to be separately held and the accused to be punished separately for the offence committed in furtherance of conspiracy. In case there is only one trial for such conspiracy for separate offences, it would enable the accused person to go scotfree and commit number of offences which is not the intendment of law,” the bench said.\n\nThe apex court also expressed its disappointment over the Jharkhand High Court delivering a “contradictory” judgment in the matter of another accused R K Rana in the case. The bench wondered how the High Court, which had quashed proceedings against Lalu, Mishra and Chakraborthy on the ground that they had been convicted in one of the fodder scam cases refused to apply the same rule to Rana’s case.\n\n“The court ought to have been careful while dealing with such matters and consistency is the hallmark of the court due to which people have faith in the system and it is not open to the court to take a different view in the same matter with reference to different accused persons in the same facts and same case,” the bench said.\n\n“Such inconsistent decision-making ought to have been avoided at all costs so as to ensure credibility of the system. The impugned orders are palpably illegal, faulty and contrary to the basic principles of law… Interference had been made at the advanced stage of the case which was wholly unwarranted and uncalled for. Let now amends be made by expediting the trial without any further hindrance from any quarter,” it said.\n\nThe scam refers to 55 cases of alleged large-scale embezzlement of government treasury funds given to non-existent companies for purchase and supply of cattle fodder in Bihar in the 1990s. Lalu was chief minister of Bihar from 1990-1997.

Following the decision, the party’s senior leadership came out in defence of Kejriwal and Jain, and accused Mishra of acting “on the behest of BJP”.\n\nKejriwal, meanwhile, broke his silence on the allegation by posting on his official Twitter account: “Jeet satya ki hogi.

It is part of a larger conspiracy. What Mishra is saying is exactly what the BJP was saying for so many months.

Kejriwal’s name is not mentioned even once in the report… When Sheila Dikshit is the accused, you keep asking questions about Kejriwal’,” Singh alleged.\n\nMishra hit back by claiming that that he was receiving death threats over his allegations and that the money handed over was allegedly linked to Kejriwal’s brother-in-law.\n\n“Satyendar Jain had personally told me that there was a land deal of Rs 50 crore for a 7-acre plot in Chhatarpur for Kejriwal’s brother-in-law… also, fake bills of Rs 10 crore from the PWD were forged. Whoever raises questions against them (AAP) becomes a BJP and Modi agent… I have fought against BJP, Congress and corruption. I will never join the BJP and I am not in touch with any BJP leader. I challenge all those sitting with Arvind Kejriwal to get proof that I am in touch with the BJP,” Mishra alleged.\n\nEchoing the remarks of some leaders who left the party recently, Mishra claimed that he has been receiving calls and messages from across the country on alleged irregularities within the party.\n\n“Volunteers, IAS officials, people from Punjab are approaching me to share details of irregulaties during the Punjab polls. I am being given details of liquor, money… during the Punjab elections.

I want to assure them that I will never leave the party. I am shaken and shocked by the information I have got. Money was sought for ticket distribution during the municipal polls (in Delhi).

(PTI Photo)\n\nEVEN AS Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday called for an aggressive strategy to tackle Maoist violence and directed Maoist-hit states to “take ownership” of operations, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar countered that the Centre cannot just play a “reviewing role” and “throw the ball in the court of states”.\n\n“We have to bring aggression in our policy, there should be aggression in our thinking, aggression in our strategy, aggression in the deployment of security forces, aggression in operations, aggression in bringing development, aggression in road construction… We will have to be cautious that extremely defensive deployment may result in reduction of operational offensive,” said Singh, addressing a conclave of chief ministers and top officers of 10 Maoist-hit states.\n\nThe meeting to review the anti-Maoist doctrine comes a fortnight after 25 CRPF personnel were killed in a Maoist attack in Sukma district of Chhattisgarh. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivaj Singh Chouhan did not attend the meeting and were represented by their home ministers or senior officials.\n\n“We have to ensure that the states take ownership in the anti-Naxal operations where Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) will cooperate fully,” said Singh. He stressed on “unity of purpose” and spoke of a unified coordination and command to counter Left Wing Extremism (LWE). He said that along with strategic command, a unified command is required at the operational and tactical level.\n\nAs many as 12,000 people lost their lives in Maoist violence over the last two decades. Of these, 2,700 were security personnel and 9,300 were innocent people, he said.\n\n“There is a need to find a solution to this problem and the strategy is available and encompassed in the word ‘samadhan’… S for smart leadership, A for aggressive strategy, M for motivation and training, A for actionable intelligence, D for dashboard based KPIs (key performance indicators) and KRAs (key result areas), H for harnessing technology, A for action plan for each threat, N for no access to financing,” said Singh.\n\nIn his speech, Nitish said that in a “federal structure, Centre cannot relegate itself to a mere reviewing role by throwing the ball in the court of states for taking effective action to neutralise this threat of Left Wing Extremism which has emerged as a challenge to internal security.”\n\nWhile he suggested several steps to combat Maoist violence, he added that “if effective steps are to be taken, then mere discussion with state governments will not suffice… the Centre will also need to take concrete steps.”\n\nOn blocking Maoists’ access to funds, Nitish said the Bihar government had submitted a proposal to the Centre stating that the power to confiscate property worth up to Rs 5 crore should be extended to an officer of the rank of Inspector General of Police in states also. At present, only the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has such powers under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).\n\nNitish also emphasised the need to continue financial grants for the schemes initiated earlier — like the Special Infrastructure Scheme, Integrated Action Plan (IAP), Security Related Expenditure and Modernisation of Police Fund among others.\n\n“In case the Centre decides to discontinue them or reduce grants, that will have a detrimental effect in the fight against LWE. Similarly, imposing the states with 100 per cent financial burden for deployment of central security forces is also devoid of logic. The ultimate objective cannot be achieved if the needs of states are not adequately addressed. Fight against Left Wing Extremism is a joint responsibility of the Centre and State. Therefore the financial burden should also be shared by both,” he said.\n\nOdisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik demanded more CAPF battalions and inclusion of three districts — Angul, Boudh and Sonepur — in the list of Maoist-affected districts, and Kalahandi in the category of worst-affected district. “I urged upon the Home Minister to provide two more battalions of CAPF to Odisha immediately to undertake effective counter measures against extremism and include the newly-affected districts of central parts of Odisha under Security Related Expenditure (SRE) scheme, and installation of 518 mobile towers in the Naxal-hit districts,” he said after the meeting.\n\nUnion Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi said almost all the states demanded that the Centre-sponsored security-related schemes should continue. “While demands for additional deployments were also raised, some states like Bihar sought exemption from payment for central forces,” Mehrishi said.\n\nThe states also raised related issues like helicopter support for operations and use of modern technology by the state police and the CAPF.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-09 04:46:51', 'i593.jpg', 1, -0.65, '(PTI Photo)\n\nEVEN AS Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday called for an aggressive strategy to tackle Maoist violence and directed Maoist-hit states to “take ownership” of operations, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar countered that the Centre cannot just play a “reviewing role” and “throw the ball in the court of states”.In his speech, Nitish said that in a “federal structure, Centre cannot relegate itself to a mere reviewing role by throwing the ball in the court of states for taking effective action to neutralise this threat of Left Wing Extremism which has emerged as a challenge to internal security.”\n\nWhile he suggested several steps to combat Maoist violence, he added that “if effective steps are to be taken, then mere discussion with state governments will not suffice… the Centre will also need to take concrete steps.”\n\nOn blocking Maoists’ access to funds, Nitish said the Bihar government had submitted a proposal to the Centre stating that the power to confiscate property worth up to Rs 5 crore should be extended to an officer of the rank of Inspector General of Police in states also.“I urged upon the Home Minister to provide two more battalions of CAPF to Odisha immediately to undertake effective counter measures against extremism and include the newly-affected districts of central parts of Odisha under Security Related Expenditure (SRE) scheme, and installation of 518 mobile towers in the Naxal-hit districts,” he said after the meeting.Home Minister Rajnath Singh.(PTI Photo) Home Minister Rajnath Singh.', 3, 24, 62, 8, 1),

After taking the medicine, she reportedly became unconscious.\n\nOn reaching his home, Tahir reportedly “sexually assaulted and tortured” her and “threatened to kill” her if she did not sign the Nikah Nama. “They made me marry forcefully,” she said. “Then they tortured me mentally, beating me, and made me do all the household work… Every evening, Tahir would sexually assault and physically torture me… I only came to know later… that Tahir already has a wife and four children… Now, all of them together harass me, beat me and torture me in every possible way, mentally, physically and emotionally,” she said in her statement.\n\nStating that she “came to the Indian High Commission, Islamabad, with Tahir to receive money which was sent by my brother from Delhi, as Tahir is a greedy person,” Uzma said, “I face danger if I return to Tahir’s village… If I go with Tahir to his village, only my dead body will come back.”\n\nHours after she gave her statement, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the Indian High Commission in Islamabad was working with the Pakistan Foreign Ministry for her “safe return”, as desired by Uzma and her family. Her brother has met External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj.\n\n“The young Indian woman, who sought shelter in the Indian High Commission in Islamabad on May 5, 2017, today recorded her statement in the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class in Islamabad, as per local legal requirement,” said MEA spokesperson Gopal Baglay.\n\n“The Indian High Commission has provided her necessary consular and legal assistance. It is coordinating with Pakistan Foreign Office for her safe return and is also in touch with her family in India on the matter. Her brother met the External Affairs Minister and requested the government’s help to rescue his sister at the earliest,” he said.\n\nUzma also told the court that she took shelter at the Indian High Commission of her own accord and would stay there till she is sent back to India with security.\n\nOn Sunday, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry had said that “the Indian High Commission informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that… Uzma had approached them with the request to be repatriated to India.” The Pakistan Foreign Ministry said that according to the Indian High Commission, Uzma claimed to have married Tahir and alleged that she later came to know that he was already married and has four children.\n\nThe Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi said the immigration documents showed that Uzma obtained her visa under the “visitor category”. Pakistani authorities have said she did not share her plans to marry in Pakistan when she applied for the visa, and only expressed her intent to visit her relatives there.\n\nTahir, meanwhile, has accused the Indian High Commission in Islamabad of detaining Uzma and filed a case with the local police.\n\nAccording to Dawn newspaper, after getting married, Uzma called up her brother in New Delhi. Her brother asked her to visit India, and told her she should meet a man named Adnan at the Indian High Commission, who would be able to sort out their visas for the trip, the report quoted Tahir as saying.\n\n“At the Indian High Commission window, she asked about Adnan. A while later, a man came out and took her inside through Gate 6. I waited and waited, and then at 7 pm I asked at the embassy gate if my wife was inside. They told me no one was inside,” said Tahir.\n\nAccording to Indian government sources, Judicial Magistrate Haider Ali Shah has ordered respondents Tahir, the cleric who solemnised the marriage, as well as other witnesses to submit a reply. Shah fixed the next hearing for July 11.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-09 04:47:43', 'i594.jpg', 1, -0.35, 'Stating that she “came to the Indian High Commission, Islamabad, with Tahir to receive money which was sent by my brother from Delhi, as Tahir is a greedy person,” Uzma said, “I face danger if I return to Tahir’s village… If I go with Tahir to his village, only my dead body will come back.”\n\nHours after she gave her statement, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the Indian High Commission in Islamabad was working with the Pakistan Foreign Ministry for her “safe return”, as desired by Uzma and her family.On Sunday, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry had said that “the Indian High Commission informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that… Uzma had approached them with the request to be repatriated to India.” The Pakistan Foreign Ministry said that according to the Indian High Commission, Uzma claimed to have married Tahir and alleged that she later came to know that he was already married and has four children.They show(ed) me a gun and threatened me… They took my signature on (the) Nikah Nama at gunpoint…”\n\nIN HER sworn statement before a court in Islamabad on Monday, Uzma, the 20-year-old Indian woman who has taken refuge at the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, has alleged that she was sexually assaulted, “tortured mentally”, and forced to marry Tahir Ali, a resident of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, “at gunpoint”.Her brother asked her to visit India, and told her she should meet a man named Adnan at the Indian High Commission, who would be able to sort out their visas for the trip, the report quoted Tahir as saying.indian woman, pakistani man, Indian High Commission, pakistani citizen, woman married at gunpoint, india news,latest news indian woman, pakistani man, Indian High Commission, pakistani citizen, woman married at gunpoint, india news,latest news\n\n“That night, Tahir sexually assaulted and tortured me and threatened to kill me if I did not sign the Nikah Nama the next day.', 3, 24, 62, 8, 1),

Kadyan alleges that “cows were slaughtered” for the biryani “without any permit”. “The meat of cow and oxen is referred to as beef. It means that all seven samples have been found beef-positive. The accused may be punished with up to seven years imprisonment for the offence,” said Kadyan.\n\nHaryana Police, however, said that they would act on Kadyan’s complaint after receiving a formal report from the university. The biryani samples were collected from seven traders in 2016 on suspicion that they contained beef. On August 24, 2016, veterinary officials of the Animal Husbandry Department had sent the samples to the university. On September 6, 2016, the university had mentioned that “all seven samples are from cattle species”. However, officials of the Animal Husbandry Department wanted more clarity on the lab test results.\n\nIn a letter to the in-charge of Government Veterinary Hospital, Firozpur Jhirka (Mewat), on Monday, the university said: “…it is clarified that the term ‘cattle’ mentioned in this report refers to cow/oxen.” When contacted by The Indian Express, Dr Y Singh, head of university’s Department of Veterinary Public Health & Epidemiology, confirmed that they had sent a clarification to the veterinary officials.\n\nSoon after coming to know about the development, Kadyan, who has been pursuing the issue, said that now police should lodge an FIR without delay. On May 2, Kadyan had filed a police complaint with the CM window and the Firozepur Jhirka police station after accessing the September 2016 lab report “unofficially”.

Express Archive The gang of Nabha jailbreak gangster Vicky Gounder has been allegedly involved in several crimes recently, causing major embarrassment to the police and government. Express Archive\n\nA SUDDEN spate of crimes across Punjab has caught the new government off guard. In the 10 weeks since it assumed office, the Congress government has been facing a fresh wave of gangwars, bank robberies and killings that are being described as political murders. In the latest case of gangwar, a bouncer was gunned down in the Saketri area of Panchkula on Monday. The killing is being linked to the gang of Nabha jailbreak gangster Vicky Gounder. In a post on his Facebook page – the first ever after he escaped from Nabha jail — on Sunday evening, he purportedly wrote that he had no role in the Banur and Sarawan Bodla dacoities and police were “deliberately slapping false cases on me”. He further wrote in Punjabi dialect with English letters, “Whatever we do, we do it to settle personal enmity. What we will do ourselves, everyone will come to know of that on their own,” he further wrote in a Punjabi dialect with English alphabets.\n\nA Punjab police officer said the police were verifying whether the gang war was linked to the Gounder gang. The Punjab police seemed baffled by this spurt in crime and the perpetrators behind them as they were in many cases during the previous SAD-BJP regime. Police are still looking for leads in a robbery where six armed men robbed Rs 1.33 crore from an Axis Bank cash van on the busy Banur-Rajpur road on Tuesday morning and another robbery at the State Bank of India branch in Sarawan Bodla village of Muktsar district on Wednesday. Gounder hails from this village. Two weeks ago, the Gounder gang shot dead three members of a rival group in Gurdaspur district. Earlier, the sarpanch of a Hoshiarpur village was gunned down in Chandigarh in broad daylight by members of a Punjab gang. The same gang had shot dead a 48-year-old man at his home at Bahman Majra village in Nurpur Bedi in Ropar district days before.\n\n“I have already issued directions to the field officers to form special anti-gangster squads to nab the gangsters. The special task force that deals with the gangsters reports to the intelligence wing and not to me,” said ADGP (Law and Order) Rohit Choudhary. SAD, which lost the election, is already describing the situation as the “worst breakdown” of law and order in the state, a charge that the Congress used to level against it just months ago.\n\n“This is the worst law and order situation in Punjab in the last one decade. Political murders, bank dacoities, gang wars are the order of the day. Law and order is at its lowest ebb,” said SAD president Daljit Singh Cheema, who is regularly updating a list of cases categorising them as “vendetta cases”, “crime cases”, “police excesses”, “extortion cases by Punjab police” and “harassment of SAD members by Congress leaders to control constitutional bodies”. Cheema’s list contains over 30 incidents, including at least five of murders of Akali supporters, allegedly by Congressmen. “Isolated incidents did take place in our time. But, the frequency at which incidents are happening indicates it is a free for all now,” he said, adding, “Ensuring law and order should be the top priority and the chief minister, who is holding the home portfolio, is accountable for that.”\n\nFormer deputy speaker Bir Devinder Singh said people had elected Congress in the hope that law and order would improve. “But, it has worsened. If the chief minister, also the home minister, is unwell or preoccupied with something, he should give the home ministry portfolio to any other minister who can devote time,” he retorted. “Gangwars are happening in a manner as if bulls are clashing on the streets. Robbery is taking place on a busy road outside a private university and police do not act quickly to nab the robbers,” said Devinder.\n\nAdmitting that gangs were a cause of concern, a senior police officer, on condition of anonymity, said, “But police are on the job to nab gangsters.

Express Archive The “no jeans rule” in the written order by the office of the DGSE does not mention male staff. Express Archive\n\nThe office of Punjab’s Director General School Education (DGSE) has ordered teachers in government schools not to wear “indecent and provocative clothes like jeans, tops and fashionable dresses” to work. The “no jeans rule” in the written order by the office of the DGSE does not mention male staff. In fact, it does not specify any dressing rules for male teachers. The order, a copy of which is with The Indian Express, says,”We are receiving complaints regarding indecent dressing by teachers in schools, especially female teachers, who are coming to school wearing indecent (bhadkaau) clothes. The women teachers are wearing jeans, tops and other provocative (uksaau) fashionable dresses and coming for duty. This is also affecting the students. So, dress code should be implemented at the earliest in all schools.” District education officers (DEOs) have also been ordered to conduct inspections at government schools across state to ensure that the “dress code” is implemented.\n\nThe order, however, does not specify what a “decent” dress code is. Speaking to The Indian Express, Amarbir Singh, Assistant Director (Secondary Education), who issued order, said that “jeans and tops are indecent and not a part of Punjabi culture”. “They can wear suits. There has to be a proper dupatta. Even saris are okay but not jeans and tops. Teachers are role models for children and they have to wear something which keeps the body completely covered. If they wear T-shirts, then there is no dupatta, which is not acceptable. Some even come in pyjamas which is unacceptable,” he said.\n\nAdding that “no type of Western wear” can be worn by women teachers, he said, “Suits and saris are part of our culture. We have received many complaints of female teachers coming dressed inappropriately. Students’ minds are affected if a teacher is not properly dressed. Now, proper inspections will be held and those teachers coming dressed indecently will be pointed out. School is not a place to show your wardrobe collection of Western clothes.” Asked if the “no jeans rule” also applies to male teachers, he said, “Yes, of course, it is for male teachers too. They also cannot come in kurta-pyjama or jeans or without proper turban. They have to dress up properly in shirts and trousers.”\n\nReacting to the orders, a female teacher said, “The order specifies that female teachers are dressing indecently. If a no jeans rule is for both male and female teachers, then why was is it not mentioned in the letter? Why only female teachers have been told to avoid jeans and tops? Is this how Punjab education department is setting an example of gender equality? Most of our male colleagues come wearing jeans, but the letter has failed to say this. There is not a word written on how male teachers should dress up during school hours.”\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-09 04:51:57', 'i603.jpg', 1, 0.05, 'The “no jeans rule” in the written order by the office of the DGSE does not mention male staff.The “no jeans rule” in the written order by the office of the DGSE does not mention male staff.Express Archive The “no jeans rule” in the written order by the office of the DGSE does not mention male staff.School is not a place to show your wardrobe collection of Western clothes.” Asked if the “no jeans rule” also applies to male teachers, he said, “Yes, of course, it is for male teachers too.Express Archive\n\nThe office of Punjab’s Director General School Education (DGSE) has ordered teachers in government schools not to wear “indecent and provocative clothes like jeans, tops and fashionable dresses” to work.', 3, 24, 62, 8, 1);

These are the views of B B Kumar, the newly-appointed chairman of the Indian Council Of Social Science Research (ICSSR), which were published in the form of signed editorials in Dialogue, an English quarterly journal he edits, over the last two years.\n\nAs first reported by The Indian Express, Kumar, an anthropologist by training, was appointed on May 2 by the HRD Ministry as the head of ICSSR, the apex body for promoting research in social sciences. He joined office on May 5.\n\nKumar succeeded Sukhdeo Thorat, who was the council’s chairman since April 2011. The 76-year-old was shortlisted by a panel with Ashok Modak, National Research Professor and former BJP MLC from Maharashtra, and historian Satish Mittal, president of the RSS-backed Akhil Bharathiya Itihaas Sankalan Yojana, as members.\n\nKumar is ex-principal of Sao Change Government College, Tuensang (Nagaland), and Science College, Kohima, and has written, edited and co-authored 136 books.\n\nExcerpts from Kumar’s editorials in Dialogue between 2015 and 2016:\n\nVictim of intolerance\n\nIn an editorial titled ‘Learn to tolerate Modi’, which was published in the 2015 October-December edition, Kumar criticised the Prime Minister’s adversaries:\n\n“Narendra Modi has proved himself to be the best Prime Minister. The economy of the country was in bad shape, when he came to power; in the brief period, we have overtaken China in GDP growth; steps have been taken towards economic empowerment of the people, foreign investment is coming in a big way, no cases of corruption or scams have come up…\n\n“The problem with the adversaries of Narendra Modi, is that they lack the realisation that while trying to harm Narendra Modi, they are harming the country. Narendra Modi became PM in spite of more than a decade long warnings, and lodging court cases against him. Obviously people of India did not believe Modi-baiters…\n\n“A fact, which many of us feel, and feel deeply, is that there is none in India, who has suffered more due to intolerance than Narendra Modi. It is time his adversaries should try to learn to tolerate him.”\n\nUntouchability due to conversion\n\nIn an editorial published in the January-March issue of 2016, Kumar wrote:\n\n“(Arab scholar) Al-Biruni, only a thousand years ago, talks of only the four castes, and all sitting and eating at one place; no caste proliferation, and no untouchability…\n\n“Aggressive anti-Hindu agenda of conversion of the Muslim rulers, their capture and sale of Hindus as slaves, etc., led lakhs of Hindus to run away to the forests for saving themselves; many started taking pig’s flesh to avoid becoming Muslims; they, eventually, become Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes… A point, needing emphasis, is that caste in the present form, untouchability and intra-Hindu societal exploitation are entirely non-Hindu factors. Dominant JNU type scholarship in the field of Social Sciences has neither the tendency nor the will and understanding to put the discourse in proper perspective.”\n\nMarxism led to decline\n\nKumar describes Macaulayism and Marxism as the “most potent weapons imported by the Britishers in India”. In the July-September issue of 2015, he wrote:\n\n“The British knew that the Marxism was helpful for British Empire; and that was the reason that they used to supply Marxist literature to the freedom fighters in jails, and the latter used to come out from the jails as Marxists…\n\n“We are gradually losing the capacity to generate original ideas, and the reason behind the same is the continuance of Macaulayist education system and dominance of Marxists and leftists in the Indian academia. It is precisely the reason that the intellectual decline is visible everywhere now a days.”\n\nIn same editorial, he called for an urgent review of NCERT textbooks by the government as they are driven by political agenda and “partly responsible for the increasing social conflicts and the anarchical trends in the society”.\n\nJNU hurt sentiments\n\nWriting on the sedition controversy surrounding JNU in an editorial that appeared in the January-March 2016 issue, Kumar wrote:\n\n“The happenings in JNU campus have made some facts clear: (i) The belief that the partition of India brought the end of Pakistan ideology on Indian soil is a myth. (ii) The destructive role of Marxist-Leninist ideology in India tenaciously persists…\n\n“The Naxalite support, for every secessionist cause in India, is a well-known fact, needing no elaboration. The only shocking addition is the brave show of Pakistani face of some Indian Muslims, boldly declaring the destruction of India. The question is: Does India need to tackle a Pakistani Jehadi activist and ideologue, when his replica in flesh and blood is present in Delhi itself?”\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-09 04:52:50', 'i604.jpg', 1, -0.6, 'In the July-September issue of 2015, he wrote:\n\n“The British knew that the Marxism was helpful for British Empire; and that was the reason that they used to supply Marxist literature to the freedom fighters in jails, and the latter used to come out from the jails as Marxists…\n\n“We are gradually losing the capacity to generate original ideas, and the reason behind the same is the continuance of Macaulayist education system and dominance of Marxists and leftists in the Indian academia.B B Kumar was appointed ICSSR chairman on May 2 B B Kumar was appointed ICSSR chairman on May 2\n\nNARENDRA MODI is the best prime minister and the worst victim of intolerance; caste in its present form and untouchability are a result of Arab, Turk and Mughal invasions; Macaulayism and the dominance of Marxists led to India’s intellectual decline; and, the Opposition’s support to JNU students hurt nationalistic sentiments.It is time his adversaries should try to learn to tolerate him.”\n\nUntouchability due to conversion\n\nIn an editorial published in the January-March issue of 2016, Kumar wrote:\n\n“(Arab scholar) Al-Biruni, only a thousand years ago, talks of only the four castes, and all sitting and eating at one place; no caste proliferation, and no untouchability…\n\n“Aggressive anti-Hindu agenda of conversion of the Muslim rulers, their capture and sale of Hindus as slaves, etc., led lakhs of Hindus to run away to the forests for saving themselves; many started taking pig’s flesh to avoid becoming Muslims; they, eventually, become Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes… A point, needing emphasis, is that caste in the present form, untouchability and intra-Hindu societal exploitation are entirely non-Hindu factors.The economy of the country was in bad shape, when he came to power; in the brief period, we have overtaken China in GDP growth; steps have been taken towards economic empowerment of the people, foreign investment is coming in a big way, no cases of corruption or scams have come up…\n\n“The problem with the adversaries of Narendra Modi, is that they lack the realisation that while trying to harm Narendra Modi, they are harming the country.Dominant JNU type scholarship in the field of Social Sciences has neither the tendency nor the will and understanding to put the discourse in proper perspective.”\n\nMarxism led to decline\n\nKumar describes Macaulayism and Marxism as the “most potent weapons imported by the Britishers in India”.', 3, 24, 61, 8, 1),

The university will hold its 143rd AC meeting on May 9.\n\nSources said Kishwar was sent an official letter on May 3 to attend the meeting which is expected to debate changes in the university admissions policy including deep cuts in MPhil and PhD seats.\n\nKishwar, founding editor of Manushi, is a graduate of Miranda House and JNU and has widely researched and written on issues of gender and politics. In 2014, she published Modi, Muslims and Media: Voices from Narendra Modi’s Gujarat.\n\nThe move to appoint Kishwar hasn’t gone down well with a section of the faculty, including the Dean of SAA. Some teachers criticised Kishwar’s nomination saying her name was not among the list of experts provided by the School to the V-C. Every School is required to suggest at least four names from outside the university from which the V-C usually picks one.\n\nWhen contacted, SAA Dean Bishnupriya Dutt said: “We were given a letter asking us to suggest names of experts pertaining to the discipline. We sent six names of people who are prominent in the field of arts. Her (Kishwar’s) name wasn’t part of the list because she has nothing to do with the study of the arts.”\n\n“We are very confused and bewildered why these names were rejected and somebody who has no connection with our discipline was selected. It has never happened before in the 17 years of this school’s existence. Until date, one of the names — and usually the first name on the list — is the one that has been selected by the V-C. We have asked the Registrar the reason why this happened; I am sure they have a logical explanation for this,” Dutt said.\n\nSpeaking to The Indian Express, Kishwar said she was unaware of her nomination and that she had not applied for the same.\n\nOn the Dean’s criticism that she had “no connection” with the School’s discipline — cinema studies, theatre & performance studies, and visual studies — Kishwar said: “I have made several documentaries, at least 13 of them, which have been screened on Doordarshan. I am also working on a book on Bollywood, as well as a book and film on India’s traditional art performers. I have also written countless film reviews. Not that I care about the uproar but they should at least look at my CV before they speak nonsense.”\n\nSaid JNUTA president Ayesha Kidwai: “The VC has cited some mysterious rule from 2005 and illegally given himself the powers to nominate members from outside the list provided by schools.”\n\nDenying any irregularity, JNU Rector Chintamani Mahapatra said: “There are many provisions in the JNU statutes which give the V-C the power to nominate people to different committees, including the AC. Whether a V-C is going to nominate on his own or take the advice of the Dean or the School is up to him. This is hundred per cent legal.”\n\nMahapatra added that to expect the V-C to only pick from the list provided by the School would be a “restriction of his powers”.\n\nAsked about the Dean’s objection, he said, “I don’t know why they (teachers) are saying this. If we start evaluating all the past names, then anyone can be similarly blamed. Who’s going to decide who is the best person in a particular field?

Sources in Afghanistan told The Indian Express that the raid by Afghan and US special forces on April 27, which claimed Hasib’s life, was part of strikes that also led to the death of two IS members from Kerala: Bestin Vincent alias Yahiya from Palakkad, and the commander of Indian jihadists in the region, Sajeer Mangalasseri Abdulla, a former resident of Sultan Batheri.\n\nUSFOR said, “(Hasib) directed the March 8 attack against Kabul National Military Hospital, which resulted in the deaths and injury of over one hundred innocent Afghans. Hasib also directed fighters to behead local elders in front of their families and ordered the kidnapping of women and girls to force them to marry Islamic State fighters.”\n\nGeneral John Nicholson, commander of USFOR, said, “This successful joint operation is another important step in our relentless campaign to defeat the Islamic State in 2017.”\n\nLeft increasingly leaderless by the raids, the survivors of the 25-strong community from Kerala, who once lived in homes seized from local villagers, are believed to have retreated deeper into the Spin Ghar mountains, making reliable communications with their families more difficult.\n\nHaseeb, appointed emir or head of the Islamic State’s Khorasan branch by the organisation’s so-called caliph Ibrahim Awad al-Badri in November 2016, had a long-standing relationship with Pakistan-based jihadist groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba.\n\nThe LeT ties, Afghan intelligence officials say, were key to his decision to take on a number of Indian jihadists in the group’s ranks.\n\nEducated during his early years at the Jami’a Imam Bukhari of Haji Inayat-ur-Rehman in Peshawar, Haseeb later studied at another seminary in the city, Abu Muhammad Aminullah’s Ganj madrassa.\n\nFBI notices seeking Aminullah’s arrest say he is “wanted for questioning in connection with providing material support to Al-Qaeda, the Taliban and anti-coalition militias, with the aid of a Pakistan-based terrorist group, Lashkar-e-Taiba”.\n\nAminullah, it says, operates as “a financier, recruiter and weapons facilitator for the [Ganj] madrassa”.\n\nThe two seminaries where Haseeb studied were set up with the support of the LeT, as part of an effort to establish an ideological base loyal to the Ahl-e-Hadith’s jihadist wing in the region. At the time, this wing was dominated by mujahideen groups with theological roots in seminaries that were linked to the Deobandi movement in Pakistan, or to local traditions in Afghanistan.\n\nIn 1990, the new Lashkar-backed party — Jamil-ur-Rahman’s Jama’at al-Dawa ila al-Qur’an wal-Sunna — contested local elections held by mujahideen groups in Afghanistan’s Kunar province, and set up an Islamic emirate.\n\nHelped by the Lashkar’s Hafiz Saeed, it succeeded in raising extensive funds from Saudi Arabia, even though it was not among the seven mujahideen parties officially recognised by Pakistan. The patronage made it powerful enemies, though, key among them warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who decimated the group by 1991.\n\nAbdul Rahim Muslim Dost, who swore an oath of loyalty to the Islamic State in June, 2014, and was then appointed deputy chief of its Afghan chapter — only to defect the following year — was among Jamil-ur-Rahman’s deputies in the Kunar Islamic Emirate.\n\nThe Islamic State in Afghanistan, though, became a magnet for many Pakistani jihadists evicted from their country by the Pakistan army. In October, 2014, slain jihadist Sheikh Maqbool — a former Tehreek-e-Taliban spokesperson — pledged allegiance to the Islamic State saying “the Quran makes it mandatory for the Muslims to follow their caliph”.\n\nFive other Tehreek-e-Taliban leaders joined him in the pledge including the first chief of the new Islamic State Khorasan wing, Saeed Khan, who was killed in a drone strike in November.\n\nIntense operations targeting the Islamic State in Afghanistan, intelligence sources said, have disrupted plans to move Indian jihadists still with the Islamic State in Syria, as well as new volunteers, to locations in Nangarhar. These plans are suspected to have been firmed up this summer, western intelligence sources sources say, when the Islamic State moved its leadership to al-Mayadin, in Syria’s Deir es-Zor region, deep in the Euphrates valley.\n\nEven as leaders and their families were barred from leaving the city without permission, top foreign commanders were told to prepare to wage a long war in the periphery, using the cadre in their home countries rather than in the so-called caliphate.\n\nFollowing this, instead of calling potential recruits to Syria, Indian Islamic State recruiters began distributing instructions on making simple improvised explosive devices, and urged followers to stage attacks on Hindu nationalist leaders and Muslims critical of the jihadist movement. Those who demonstrated commitment, intelligence officials believe, were to be called to Afghanistan.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-09 04:56:22', 'i608.jpg', 1, 0.3, 'Intense operations targeting the Islamic State in Afghanistan, intelligence sources said, have disrupted plans to move Indian jihadists still with the Islamic State in Syria, as well as new volunteers, to locations in Nangarhar.Hasib also directed fighters to behead local elders in front of their families and ordered the kidnapping of women and girls to force them to marry Islamic State fighters.”\n\nGeneral John Nicholson, commander of USFOR, said, “This successful joint operation is another important step in our relentless campaign to defeat the Islamic State in 2017.”\n\nLeft increasingly leaderless by the raids, the survivors of the 25-strong community from Kerala, who once lived in homes seized from local villagers, are believed to have retreated deeper into the Spin Ghar mountains, making reliable communications with their families more difficult.Sources in Afghanistan told The Indian Express that the raid by Afghan and US special forces on April 27, which claimed Hasib’s life, was part of strikes that also led to the death of two IS members from Kerala: Bestin Vincent alias Yahiya from Palakkad, and the commander of Indian jihadists in the region, Sajeer Mangalasseri Abdulla, a former resident of Sultan Batheri.Photo for representational purpose Photo for representational purpose\n\nSheikh Abdul Hasib, head of Islamic State’s operations in Afghanistan and the central figure in a multinational operation to train Indian jihadists in the Nangarhar mountains, has been killed with several other commanders and at least 35 fighters, according to USFOR, the headquarters of US forces in the war-torn country.Abdul Rahim Muslim Dost, who swore an oath of loyalty to the Islamic State in June, 2014, and was then appointed deputy chief of its Afghan chapter — only to defect the following year — was among Jamil-ur-Rahman’s deputies in the Kunar Islamic Emirate.', 3, 24, 61, 8, 1),

Express file General Bipin Rawat, Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa, Admiral Sunil Lanba. Express file\n\nWhile the chiefs of the three defence services appeared together to issue the Joint Doctrine last month, the three forces disagree on the proposal to create integrated theatre commands. The Army is in favour of the proposal, while the Air Force is strongly opposed to it. While the Navy’s view is more nuanced, it too is not in favour of implementing the proposal currently.\n\nFollowing the recommendations of the expert committee headed by Lt General D B Shekatkar (retd), which submitted its report to then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar in January, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has sought the views of the three service chiefs by the end of the month.\n\nAccording to MoD sources, the proposal is to create three integrated theatre commands: northern command for the China border, western command for the Pakistan border and southern command for the maritime borders. As the borders with Pakistan and China are land-centric, it is expected that the northern and western commands would have to be headed by an Army General. The southern command would have to be headed by a Navy Admiral.\n\nThe Army’s rationale for integrated theatre commands is based on the need to have a unified direction and control of war. This was put forth by the Army during deliberations on the proposal at the combined commanders conference, chaired by the Prime Minister, at Dehradun in February. According to an official who attended the conference, Eastern Army Commander Lt General Praveen Bakshi remarked that while the opposing side in China has a single command, the Indian side has seven commands of the Army and Air Force for the same task.\n\n“Why should we have 17 military commands in the country? We need combat efficiency and economy of resources. With a single commander, you can have all the military assets under him. For eg, on the Pakistan border, there are at least three Army commands and two Air Force commands. We should ideally have one integrated command, as all modern militaries have, such as the United States or even China,” a senior Army officer told The Indian Express.\n\nBut the Air Force contends that foreign examples are not applicable to the Indian situation. “The US has global roles where it can’t move assets from one theatre to another. We have no such problems of distance and time. The Chinese have the theatre commands because Xi Jinping wanted to reduce the power of the PLA (Chinese military),” said a top Air Force officer.\n\nAccording to the Air Force, India should be considered as a single theatre where resources can be easily moved between various areas as required. “With only 34 fighter squadrons instead of 45, do we have the luxury of allocating them to individual commands. When we have 60 squadrons, we can do that. Also, we have three AWACS and six mid-air refuellers. How does one distribute them? Do we even need to, unless the country is willing to spend even more to buy these platforms,” said the Air Force officer.\n\nThe Navy’s position on the matter is more nuanced. “While there is a need for greater jointness among the three services, it is not appropriate to move to integrated theatre commands anytime soon. The Navy has a much wider maritime role across the seas, where a lot of coordination between various commands is done by the Naval headquarters. If these individual commands go under different theatre commanders, these assets will not be available practically,” a Navy officer explained.\n\n“There is a myth about common assets between the three services. The helicopters and the UAVs are used by all the three services. But while the Army wants these helicopters to fly at Siachen, we want them to fly at sea level. How are they the same,” the officer said.\n\nThe diversity of views means that it will require the ministry and the government to take the lead. But, adding to the uncertainty is the fact that Defence Secretary G Mohan Kumar is scheduled to retire later this month and there is no clarity on the appointment of a full-time Defence Minister. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley currently has additional charge of the MoD.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now', '2017-05-09 04:57:04', 'i609.jpg', 1, 0.65, 'The Army is in favour of the proposal, while the Air Force is strongly opposed to it.Express file\n\nWhile the chiefs of the three defence services appeared together to issue the Joint Doctrine last month, the three forces disagree on the proposal to create integrated theatre commands.According to an official who attended the conference, Eastern Army Commander Lt General Praveen Bakshi remarked that while the opposing side in China has a single command, the Indian side has seven commands of the Army and Air Force for the same task.Following the recommendations of the expert committee headed by Lt General D B Shekatkar (retd), which submitted its report to then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar in January, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has sought the views of the three service chiefs by the end of the month.As the borders with Pakistan and China are land-centric, it is expected that the northern and western commands would have to be headed by an Army General.', 3, 24, 61, 9, 1),

AAP leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira.\n\nOn a day when the Aam Aadmi Party suspended its Delhi MLA Kapil Mishra for alleging that party chief Arvind Kejriwal had accepted Rs 2 crore from a Cabinet colleague, faultlines emerged in its Punjab unit with the party’s chief whip quitting the post. Sukhpal Singh Khaira’s resignation came after a meeting between Kejriwal and the party’s Punjab MLAs on Monday when Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann was elected as convenor of AAP’s state unit. AAP had performed below expectations in the Punjab assembly elections, securing 20 seats in the 117-member House. Speaking to The Indian Express, sources in AAP’s Punjab unit, who attended the meeting in Delhi, described the session as “stormy” and said that Khaira had quit “in protest” over the decision to appoint Mann to the key post.\n\nSources said the outgoing convenor Gurpreet Singh Waraich, too, objected to the manner in which the change was announced. “Gurpreet said he was humiliated and that he could have been informed of the decision on phone and would have tendered his resignation. He said he had been defending the various indiscretions of Mann in public,” said sources. Sources said Kejriwal responded to Waraich’s remarks by saying that that he had warned Mann not to indulge in actions that cause embarrassment to the party.\n\nOfficially, however, the party sought to play down the rift with H S Phoolka, AAP MLA and Leader of Opposition in Punjab, saying that Mann was chosen unanimously and that “there was no face-off” over the decision.\n\nAlso Read | AAP crisis: Kapil Mishra presses on for a probe, party suspends him\n\nMann claimed that his appointment “was approved by an overwhelming majority with 98 per cent of those present” and that Kejriwal had rejected Khaira’s resignation. Khaira, however, confirmed his resignation in an official statement that sought to “set at rest different kind of rumours”.\n\n”I have asked Mr Kejriwal to relieve me from the posts of Chief Whip and the Spokesperson of the party with immediate effect. I requested that these positions be given to leaders who are more deserving than me in the party. I am very happy to serve the party as an ordinary volunteer and elected representative of the people,” he said.\n\nBut Mann’s comments to The Indian Express indicated that Khaira was keen on becoming the convenor.\n\n”Sukhpal Khaira was projecting himself as the new convenor but the problem was that there was no one with him to support his claim. In fact, he said Bhagwant is my younger brother and he congratulated me for having been appointed as convenor. As for his resignation, he said in the meeting that his work as an MLA was taking a lot of his time and that he is resigning from the post of spokesperson and chief whip. However, Arvind Kejriwal rejected his resignation by voice vote,” said Mann.\n\nSources said another AAP leader, Amarinder Gill, a member of the Panjab University Senate, also objected to Mann’s appointment, saying that the party needed a leader with “a good image”.\n\nKejriwal had called the 20 MLAs for the meeting along with nearly 70 other prominent workers of the party. Apart from Mann, Sunam MLA Aman Arora’s name was announced as co-convenor of AAP in Punjab while Jagraon MLA Sarvjit Kaur Manuke was designated as Deputy Leader of Opposition in the assembly.\n\nAAP sources said the appointment of Mann was announced by Kejriwal after holding separate meetings with the workers. “It seemed that it was a premeditated decision and the meeting of MLAs was called just for the sake of it,” said a senior AAP leader, who was present at the meeting.\n\nSources said Khaira argued that Mann needed to share the responsibility for AAP’s poll performance in Punjab because he was the party’s “star campaigner” and had approved all the tickets that were distributed.\n\nSpeaking to The Indian Express, H S Phoolka said: “There was no face-off or anything and it was just that Khaira said that since the party was being re-structured the post of spokesperson may also be given to someone else.” He denied that Khaira or Wariach were upset over the appointment.\n\nMann told The Indian Express that neither Khaira nor Waraich had objected to his appointment.\n\n”Arvindji said there was no doubt in anyone’s mind about Gurpreet’s abilities. He said it was Gurpreet and me who had done the major work during the run-up to the elections. Arvindji said that if anyone was responsible for the setback in Punjab, it was him as the national convenor of the party. We will all work together, strengthen the party and end all groupism,” he said.\n\nMann said that the party needed “a new structure” in Punjab. “I want that the term convenor should not be used and instead the word ‘pradhan’ should be used.

It is part of a larger conspiracy. What Mishra is saying is exactly what the BJP was saying for so many months. It has now become a joke and people are asking that when Kejriwal was taking a bribe, did he call Mishra and ask him to verify the notes?

Kejriwal’s name is not mentioned even once in the report… When Sheila Dikshit is the accused, you keep asking questions about Kejriwal’,” Singh alleged.\n\nMishra hit back by claiming that that he was receiving death threats over his allegations and that the money handed over was allegedly linked to Kejriwal’s brother-in-law.\n\n“Satyendar Jain had personally told me that there was a land deal of Rs 50 crore for a 7-acre plot in Chhatarpur for Kejriwal’s brother-in-law… also, fake bills of Rs 10 crore from the PWD were forged.

I challenge all those sitting with Arvind Kejriwal to get proof that I am in touch with the BJP,” Mishra alleged.\n\nEchoing the remarks of some leaders who left the party recently, Mishra claimed that he has been receiving calls and messages from across the country on alleged irregularities within the party.\n\n“Volunteers, IAS officials, people from Punjab are approaching me to share details of irregulaties during the Punjab polls. I am being given details of liquor, money… during the Punjab elections.

The warning, first reported by NBC News, came up during a discussion of White House personnel.White House spokesman Sean Spicer, responding to the reports, told a news briefing: "It''s true that the president, President Obama, made it known that he wasn''t exactly a fan of General Flynn''s" during a one-hour meeting on Nov. 10 with Trump.An Obama spokesman initially declined to comment.Flynn has emerged as a central figure in probes into allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion between Trump''s campaign and Moscow.He had been pushed out by Obama in 2014 from his job as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, during the Democratic president''s term in office.A former U.S. deputy attorney general, Sally Yates, is expected to tell a Senate Judiciary subcommittee later Monday that she had warned the White House counsel after Trump took office that Flynn had not told the truth about conversations he had held with Russia''s ambassador to Washington.Trump fired Flynn, a retired general, in February for failing to disclose talks with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak about U.S. sanctions on Moscow and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.Congressional committees began investigating after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacking of Democratic political groups to try to sway the election toward Trump. Moscow has denied any such meddling.Trump has also dismissed the allegations, suggesting instead that Obama might have wiretapped Trump Tower in New York or that China may have been behind the cyber attacks. He has provided no evidence and neither scenario has been supported by intelligence agencies.Hours before Monday''s Senate hearing, Trump insinuated that Yates, an Obama administration appointment, had leaked information on Flynn to the media."Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Council," Trump wrote on Twitter, apparently mis-spelling the word counsel.In another Twitter post, Trump noted that Flynn had been granted top security clearance while working in the Obama administration.Flynn was fired from the DIA in 2014 for what officials familiar with the issue said was a disruptive management style that included instructing analysts to find intelligence substantiating improbable theories that some subordinates came to call "Flynn facts."

She was speaking to The Independent outside the building site in Cala Egos where the AluaSoul Mallorca Resort is taking shape.This week is the beginning of summer in the travel industry, with tour operators launching their peak-season offerings. But in scenes reminiscent of the 1970s film Carry On Abroad, hundreds of Thomson package holidaymakers who were expecting to be the first people to enjoy a newly refurbished luxury resort have been moved to other properties.Sarah Brignell, a decorator from Sevenoaks, told The Independent: "There was no one at the airport to tell us, no one on the coach to tell us. We arrived, they took our bags off, then somebody came out and shooed us straight back into the coach again. They said: ''We don''t know what we''re going to do with you yet''. Nobody was sure where we were going to go."The upmarket resort, which has been developed from two existing properties, was due to open on 1 May. Thomson tells customers: "The all-new AluaSoul Mallorca Resort promises five pools, a trio of restaurants and a spa — along with a beachfront location." When The Independent visited, dozens of workmen were at work on the property, while in ground-floor rooms beds and mattresses were upended and in their original packaging. It is now expected to open on 10 May, though Thomson is selling holidays there only from 18 May.Ms Frier said Britain''s biggest holiday company had blamed "health and safety" when she arrived on Monday morning for a holiday that had cost her £600. "Thomson told us it had failed a health and safety report on the morning we arrived. But it was a building site."But The Independent has learned that Thomson was made aware of problems before the first guests arrived. A spokesperson for the AluaSoul hotel group said: "We alerted the tour operator the night before the arrival — which was the soonest we could given the circumstances."Security guards are stationed at entrances to the AluaSoul while work continues. But the unfinished hotel has become a local curiosity among both residents of Cala Egos and holidaymakers who were due to be staying there this week.Outside the hotel grounds, Ms Frier said: "We were so disappointed, we actually asked, ''Could we fly home, we could try and salvage something and go somewhere else?'' And they said if we wanted to do that we''d have to pay our own fares, we wouldn''t be entitled to any compensation or refund of our holiday. At that stage we were nearly in tears. We just wanted to go back home. We had been travelling for 16, 17 hours. I''m an NHS nurse. This is my first holiday in a long time. And Thomson have absolutely ruined it."Eventually some alternatives were found, though of a lower standard than the AluaSoul had promised. "We''d booked fantastic rooms with a change of pillows if you wanted. Where we are is very uncomfortable. We didn''t have any hot water for the first two days. The food is questionable. It''s just not what we paid for," said Ms Brignell . "I would never, ever book Thomson again."The Independent asked for an interview with a Thomson representative on the island, but the company declined and instead issued a statement: "We are sorry the opening of the AluaSoul Majorca has been delayed until 10 May 2017. We will be contacting all customers affected directly to offer a suitable alternative free of charge and will prioritise those due to travel first. We appreciate this is disappointing so we''re closely monitoring the situation while our hotel partner completes the work to the standards that we and our customers expect."We have currently placed all customers in suitable alternative accommodation and have offered guests a gesture of goodwill due to the unexpected disruption.

For 2017, India’s economic growth is projected stable at 7.1 per cent before catapulting to 7.5 per cent going into the next year, the regional development arm of the the United Nations said. This forecast is “underpinned by higher private and public consumption and increased infrastructure spending,” the report said.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund last month projected India’s growth at 7.2 per cent in the fiscal 2017-18 and at 7.7 per cent for the next financial year. While, the Manila-headquartered Asian Development Bank sees growth jumping to 7.4 per cent in 2017-18 and 7.6 per cent in the next.\n\nEven at this rate, India will continue to clock a better growth than China, which is expected to grow at around 6.5 per cent in 2017. “Meanwhile, inflation is projected to reach 5.3-5.5 per cent in 2017 and 2018, which is somewhat above the official target of 4.5-5 per cent,” the ESCAP said.\n\nA heightened financial sector risk emanates from concentration of huge pile of soar assets sitting on the books of public sector banks, it added. These banks’ gross non-performing assets as percentage of gross advances hit almost 12 per cent in 2016. “This points to the need for bank recapitalisation.”\n\nOn the demonetisation drive taken by government during November-December last calender, the UN report said the impact would be transient on the economy. However, a slower-than-expected recovery would particularly diminish the outlook for cash-intensive sectors and supply chains for agricultural products.\n\nIn the medium-term, India will also benefit from recent reforms measures aimed at declogging supply side bottlenecks, it added. Implementation of good and services tax (GST), amendment of a bankruptcy law and opening up of pharmaceuticals, defence and civil aviation sectors will help India in its economic growth, the report said.\n\nOn the trends in the Asia-Pacific region, the UN ESCAP has found growth in the region moderating in recent years compared to its historical trend and a rebound in 2010. “The region’s export-oriented economic growth strategy is under pressure amid prolonged weakness in external demand and global trade,” the report said.\n\n“China is both a transmitter and a source of the current economic slowdown, given its role as a hub in global value chains and it rebalanced towards consumption and services,” it said.

(Representational photo) The price of a mass-premium quality house located in a metro city suburb having a ticket price of Rs 60 lakh has remained flat on a year-on-year basis. (Representational photo)\n\nThis is perhaps the best time to buy a house from the point of view of affordability in the last decade or so. According to a CLSA report, income growth in the last three years has overtaken housing prices and affordability in the current fiscal is the best since 2005.\n\nMortgage rates have come down by 150 basis points in the last two years bringing them down to 12-year lows, and this is gradually improving affordability. Every 100 basis points mortgage-rate cut is equal to 5-6 per cent price cut, CLSA has noted.\n\nData from research firm PropEquity shows the weighted average price of unsold apartments — across 8 cities — fell by 1.67 per cent sequentially over the December quarter to Rs 6,185 per sq ft.\n\nProperty prices in seven of the country’s top eight cities fell in the three months to March with builders eager to liquidate inventory in a market badly hit by demonetisation.\n\nThe price of a mass-premium quality house located in a metro city suburb having a ticket price of Rs 60 lakh has remained flat on a year-on-year basis. However, the post-tax household income has gone up by 7.5 per cent y-o-y, in FY18 to Rs 13 lakh per annum, while the loan-to-value (LTV) is at 70 per cent, and the mortgage rate at 8.5 per cent — increasing the affordability much more than in the past.\n\nLTV is a financial term used by lenders to express the ratio of a loan to the value of an asset purchased. The affordability has improved much more for the lower ticket priced homes. For instance, for a Rs 20-lakh house, credit linked subsidy scheme (CLSS) is around 10-12 per cent of cost, which has led to improvement in affordability levels to best ever.\n\nFurther, the government is incentivising affordable unit construction through changes like affordable house having a carpet area of 60 sq. metre, with affordable project seeing tax rates at effective 20 per cent (minimum alternate tax rate) versus 34 per cent. Also giving infrastructure status for such projects has further improved the sector’s ability to get cheaper loans.

The low cost carrier (LCC) is currently working out the economies of this model and says return fares could be about Rs 25,000 to places like London, Paris and Amsterdam in all-economy seating wide body aircraft. Return fares on these sectors is mostly upwards of Rs 40,000 on full service Indian and foreign airlines, especially in peak travel seasons.This January SpiceJet had placed an order for up to 205 Boeing aircraft — 155 B-737 and an optional order for 50 more that was a mix of wide and narrow body planes. "We are evaluating the low cost long haul model for which an optional order for wide body planes has been placed.

"SpiceJet will follow the same low cost/no frills model on its long haul routes as it does on its domestic and short haul international sectors where passengers pay for additional services like meals, seat selection, priority check-in, priority boarding and excess baggage. However, unlike some other international LCCs, the first (check-in) bag would be free of charge," said a SpiceJet official.A leading international long haul LCC, for instance charges $32 for a check-in bag of up to 20 kg — one way -- on its India-Southeast Asia flights. So if SpiceJet is able to offer this service at no extra cost, that will be significant saving for flyers."SpiceJet plans to have 350-380 seats on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It would be an all-economy class configuration with few select rows of SpiceMax seats offering extra leg room. Full service Air India has 256 seats on its Dreamliners with 18 in business class. (With this seating capacity) if we can cap return fares at levels of about Rs 25,000, many would prefer a European vacation when a domestic return ticket can cost the same during peak season," said another SpiceJet official, adding that the LCC is looking at London, Birmingham, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Zurich as the possible destinations. It will offer in flight entertainment on its flights from later this year.The airline did not give a firm date for starting these flights. "SpiceJet continues to study the viability of low-cost long haul travel and a decision will be taken in due course," said Ajay Singh.However, actual fares will depend on oil prices when SpiceJet launches these flights.Indian LCCs — IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir — have narrow body planes like B-737 and Airbus A-320 in their fleet. IndiGo and SpiceJet operate to nearby foreign countries like Gulf and Southeast Asia and GoAir also plans to do the same. But as of now, no Indian budget airlines flies long haul.On the other hand, foreign LCCs offer connections to as far as Australia and eastern Europe through their hubs in Dubai and Singapore and Indians are already flying long haul on them. The biggest foreign LCCs currently operating to India are Singapore-based Scoot and Tiger (both part of Singapore Airlines'' Group); Kuala Lumpur-based AirAsia; Dubai-based flydubai and Sharjah ''s Air Arabia.

Those taking the hit first are mid and senior level professionals, those with 10 to 20 years of experience, but the expectation is that lower level employees too will be hurt later in the year, as growth in the $150-billion industry slows far more than anticipated and companies move towards hiring more in the US.

The company, one of the top performers in the industry, is expected to eventually cut at least 6,000 jobs, or 2.3% of its total workforce.

The product engineering team is likely to be one of the big casualties. Wipro ended the last fiscal year with 1.81 lakh employees.Responding to TOI''s question after the earnings, Neemuchwala said, "It''s across service lines...performance appraisal is nothing new. I don''t know which conference call you''re talking about, but I have a conference call with my leadership team every month and I go through a lot of items. There are to-dos in every quarter. We have done away with the bell curve. Today, the performance measurement is not on what you were doing till yesterday, but whether you are ready for tomorrow."French IT services major Capgemini is said to be letting go off nearly 9,000 people, or nearly 5% of its workforce. A large part of this are erstwhile employees of Igate, the company that Capgemini acquired in 2015. Capgemini had asked over 35 VP, SVPs, directors and senior directors to leave in February and 200 people were asked to leave at one of its offices in Mumbai.As of March 31, Capgemini''s total headcount was 195,800; 57%, or 111,300 employees, are in offshore centres, mostly in India.Asked about the layoffs, Capgemini did not deny that some had been asked to leave, but said it expects to recruit over 20,000 new team members in India this year. "Each year our employees are evaluated based on strict performance criteria in an objective process, consistent with industry norms, to ensure we are aligned with our customer needs, business priorities, and the overall industry evolution. This leads naturally to a varying number of employees transitioning out of the organisation in any given year. We continue to accelerate our training programmes in 2017 with over 2,000 India employees having already undertaken upskilling and emerging technologies training alone," it said.Infosys said its performance management process provides for a bi-annual assessment of performance. "A continued low feedback on performance could lead to certain performance actions, including separation of an individual and this is done only after feedback. We do this every year and the numbers could vary every performance cycle," the company said in a statement.The slowdown in IT services is now palpable. Cognizant, which was growing at about 20%, expects to grow this year at only 8-10%. Infosys, which grew at 13.3% in constant currency in 2015-16, was down to 8.3% in the last fiscal and expects to grow only between 6.5% and 8.5% this year. TCS, which was growing in the teens, did just 8.3% last year.Peter Bendor Samuel, CEO of IT consulting firm Everest Group, said the industry growth has slowed and the "arbitrage first" segment (traditional IT services) is in secular decline. "When this is added to the pyramid factory model which requires new freshers to be brought in every year to keep cost low, it results in an excess of more experienced employees," he said.He thinks the most vulnerable employees are those with 3-7 years of experience. "Unfortunately, the new digital service economy is starting to further reduce the need for these employees. In many instances, the introduction of digital service models with extreme automation, can eliminate 40% or more of the FTEs (full time equivalent/employee) in a function. Finally, the new digital models require a lower proportion of FTEs offshore than the traditional arbitrage model and as these new service models take over, they will further stress the employment model," he said.Tom Reuner, SVP of intelligent automation and IT services at IT consulting firm HfS , believes that employees have to incessantly re-invent themselves as the journey toward digital transformation necessitates new skill sets and continuous learning. "Many employees will struggle to make that journey. But equally, many service providers will struggle to adapt to these new realities. Skills will become more important than just scale," he said.Ray Wang, CEO of Constellation Research, said cloud, artificial intelligence, and software platforms will lead to 20%-30% reduction of staffing by 2020.', '2017-05-09 06:39:14', 'i664.jpg', 3, -0.25, 'Capgemini had asked over 35 VP, SVPs, directors and senior directors to leave in February and 200 people were asked to leave at one of its offices in Mumbai.As of March 31, Capgemini''s total headcount was 195,800; 57%, or 111,300 employees, are in offshore centres, mostly in India.Asked about the layoffs, Capgemini did not deny that some had been asked to leave, but said it expects to recruit over 20,000 new team members in India this year."When this is added to the pyramid factory model which requires new freshers to be brought in every year to keep cost low, it results in an excess of more experienced employees," he said.He thinks the most vulnerable employees are those with 3-7 years of experience.Those taking the hit first are mid and senior level professionals, those with 10 to 20 years of experience, but the expectation is that lower level employees too will be hurt later in the year, as growth in the $150-billion industry slows far more than anticipated and companies move towards hiring more in the US.', 3, 24, 60, 9, 1),

After about a 15% rise in average airfares in the last couple of months, airlines are back with massive discounts for the lean travel months of June to August.Earlier in the day, IndiGo took the lead by offering fares as low as Rs 899. The fares are mostly for shorter sectors. For instance, an Agartala-Kolkata flight ticket can be bought for an all inclusive fare of Rs 1,599. The ticket for an Ahmedabad-Mumbai flight is available for Rs 1,299 and a Bagdogra-Guwahati flight is for Rs 899, the lowest available flash fare.Rival SpiceJet soon followed with fares such as Rs 1,189 for Delhi-Jaipur and Rs 1,642 on Mumbai-Ahmedabad.

On home loans of more than Rs 30 lakh, the country''s largest lender cut the rate to 8.50% from 8.60%. Rival banks are expected to respond with cuts as this widens their gap with SBI ''s rates, which were already the lowest.Announcing the rate cut on Monday, SBI said that this was in keeping with the Prime Minister''s vision of providing "Housing for All" by 2022. "This limited period offer is to give a boost to affordable housing . There are many potential buyers who are sitting on the fence right now — unsure of whether to buy or not. Home loan rates were already quite low and there was also a government subsidy under the Prime Minister''s Awas Yojana (PMAY). With this reduction we expect the fence sitters to take a decision," said Rajnish Kumar, MD, SBI. He added that the bank will take a decision on July 31 on extending the scheme.Under the PMAY, loans of up to Rs 9 lakh and up to Rs 12 lakh receive interest subsidy of 4% and 3% respectively, while in rural areas loans up to Rs 2 lakh will get an interest subvention of 3%. The value of the subsidy amounts to Rs 2.67 lakh for an eligible borrower.Meanwhile, the largest housing finance company HDFC said that it had already cut rates for new customers to 8.5% in February. According to an HDFC official, the company decided to trim rates due to a reduction in the marginal cost of funds. The company has been traditionally targeting a spread of 2.2-2.35%, and has been revising rates whenever the spreads move out of this range.Other large lenders including ICICI Bank and Axis Bank offer home loans at 8.65%. A new entrant in the home loan market is DBS Bank. The Singaporean lender had made its foray into the Indian mass market with the launch of the Digibank ''mobile only'' zero balance account. The bank is now offering retail borrowers home loans at 8.4% with zero processing fee. Meanwhile, Bank of India has reduced its Marginal Cost of funds-based Lending Rate (MCLR) by 10bps from 8.50% to 8.40% with effect from May 7, 2017.There is increased competition among banks for home loans which accounted for half of all credit growth in FY17. SBI''s Kumar said, "We have a 26% market share in home loans and we expect our Rs 2.3-lakh-crore portfolio to grow 17-18% this year."

Such a policy has been followed by a few startup firms that have far fewer employees to begin with as compared with an established organisation. But at Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL), which has 3,800 employees, a good performance cycle this year has provided its employees — including the office boys — a reason to cheer. All employees who completed a year in service have been provided with ESOPs of MOFSL ''s group company, Aspire Home Finance Around 85% of the total strength of the diversified financial services firm has been covered under the ESOP scheme. Of these, all of its white collar staff who''ve completed a year in service have been issued ESOPs. The quantum offered varies based on the tenure and designation of the employee in the organisation.Sudhir Dhar, director & head (HR & admin), MOFSL, told TOI, "Employee stock options have been viewed across the globe as one of the most potent tools for creating value for the contributors. It is our strong belief that our employees are our growth drivers and our competitive advantage. We have allotted employee stock options from one of our fastest growing businesses ''Aspire Home Finance''. Right from the office boys till the directors, everyone who''s been part of this wonderful journey has been rewarded."In fiscal 2017, MOFSL posted strong growth across businesses. While housing finance was up 160% year-on-year (YoY), asset management business grew 68% YoY and capital market businesses increased 40% YoY. Aspire, which provides long-term housing finance assistance to lower and middle income families towards purchase of affordable housing units, is expanding its presence to become a pan-India player.By offering ESOPs across levels, Dhar believes the company has empowered its employees to ascertain the future of their investments by continuous efforts to add to the growth of the company so that their wealth too enhances in the process.Most organisations offer ESOPs only to top-rung managers. The only other firm that offers stock options to all levels of employees is housing finance company HDFC.Commenting on the MOFSL ESOP offer to employees, Rituparna Chakraborty, executive VP, TeamLease Services , a staffing firm, said, "That''s very rare. It augurs well for the future if this becomes a more acceptable trend."Citrus Pay, which was acquired by PayU, had reportedly offered one of its office boys stock options. "Bootstrapped startups have been seen to offer ESOPs to attract and retain top talent across levels — especially when they are starting out.

The low cost carrier (LCC) is currently working out the economies of this model and says return fares could be about Rs 25,000 to places like London, Paris and Amsterdam in all-economy seating wide body aircraft. Return fares on these sectors is mostly upwards of Rs 40,000 on full service Indian and foreign airlines, especially in peak travel seasons.This January SpiceJet had placed an order for up to 205 Boeing aircraft — 155 B-737 and an optional order for 50 more that was a mix of wide and narrow body planes. "We are evaluating the low cost long haul model for which an optional order for wide body planes has been placed. There is a good market for this segment in India if a good product is offered at the right price. Imagine the demand that a fare of Rs 10,000-15,000 on Delhi-London will have," SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh had said on January 13 while signing the deal with Boeing.The airline has made headway with those plans and shared some key features with TOI. "SpiceJet will follow the same low cost/no frills model on its long haul routes as it does on its domestic and short haul international sectors where passengers pay for additional services like meals, seat selection, priority check-in, priority boarding and excess baggage. However, unlike some other international LCCs, the first (check-in) bag would be free of charge," said a SpiceJet official.A leading international long haul LCC, for instance charges $32 for a check-in bag of up to 20 kg — one way -- on its India-Southeast Asia flights. So if SpiceJet is able to offer this service at no extra cost, that will be significant saving for flyers."SpiceJet plans to have 350-380 seats on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It would be an all-economy class configuration with few select rows of SpiceMax seats offering extra leg room. Full service Air India has 256 seats on its Dreamliners with 18 in business class. (With this seating capacity) if we can cap return fares at levels of about Rs 25,000, many would prefer a European vacation when a domestic return ticket can cost the same during peak season," said another SpiceJet official, adding that the LCC is looking at London, Birmingham, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Zurich as the possible destinations. It will offer in flight entertainment on its flights from later this year.The airline did not give a firm date for starting these flights. "SpiceJet continues to study the viability of low-cost long haul travel and a decision will be taken in due course," said Ajay Singh.However, actual fares will depend on oil prices when SpiceJet launches these flights.Indian LCCs — IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir — have narrow body planes like B-737 and Airbus A-320 in their fleet. IndiGo and SpiceJet operate to nearby foreign countries like Gulf and Southeast Asia and GoAir also plans to do the same. But as of now, no Indian budget airlines flies long haul.On the other hand, foreign LCCs offer connections to as far as Australia and eastern Europe through their hubs in Dubai and Singapore and Indians are already flying long haul on them. The biggest foreign LCCs currently operating to India are Singapore-based Scoot and Tiger (both part of Singapore Airlines'' Group); Kuala Lumpur-based AirAsia; Dubai-based flydubai and Sharjah ''s Air Arabia.

These centres will help merchants in filing taxes under the new regime and also provide necessary training and support services to people. The proposal is close to getting a final approval from the government. Dinesh Kumar Tyagi , CEO, CSC e-Governance Services, told ET that the centres are proposed to act as a GST Suvidha Provider . They will also train and support merchants."The agency will have its own portal where all the details will be filled up which will be synced with the main portal of the GST," he said.

The services offered by the centres will not be free. Tyagi said the agency is in the process of working out a commission model which will be as competitive as those offered by other service providers."GST will act as a major pull factor for the CSCs, enhancing their credibility further," he said.
